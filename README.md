# Fast Recipes

## Vision Statement

FOR college students, working professionals, and individuals WHO are interested in affordable cooking ideas. THE Fast Recipes tool is a cooking command line interface, with a future goal of adding a front-end infrastructure, THAT provides users with a list of various recipes based on the given ingredients that they provide. Fast Recipes takes away the difficult process of scouring the interent for the perfect recipe and gives the user a curated list of ideas from an input of ingredients, budget, and food categories. UNLIKE other recipe tools, OUR product uses a database that pools resources from the best recipes customized to the individual user's personal goals. 

## Project Relevance
This project covers the following topics: Object Oriented Language, Test Driven Development, Multi-Threading, Unified Modeling Language (UML), Design Patterns, Debugging Code Profiling and Organization, On-the-Fly Coding, Access to Database, and Graphical User Interface (Maybe).

## Project Abstract
My project proposal is an application that randomly chooses food recipes called FastRecipes. The application lets you choose if you would like a breakfast, lunch, dinner, or a snack recipe. The idea is to have a client/server application, where the client can request recipes from the database server. I would like to program this in C++, Python, or Java; preferably C++ or Python. And, I believe that this project reaches the educational goals.

8 and 5. She is a single mother taking care of her two children on her

with an hour long commute in city traffic, she picks her kids up from
daycare and takes them home to prepare dinner. She wants to stay on
top of her budget and she can't afford to have them eat out every
day. She uses her smart phone everyday and her kids play games on
their tablets. She would like to be able to diversify the meals she
cooks for her kids, but with all the stress of work and family she
doesn't have time to scour the internet for various recipes. She would
like to have an easy, curated way to access a broad variety of
healthy, simple, and afforable recipes.

earn bachelorâ€™s in business administration to improve his career
prospects. His wife Danielle is in school to become a physician. They
recently moved to Boston so she can start at Harvard Medical
School. Neither have ever cooked consistently and they spend too much
of his GI Bill on fast food and eating out to make ends meet in their
new city. To save money Daniel has taken to doing the shopping on the
weekend and preparing meals for the week but is exasperated by the
process of finding meals that fit both of their preferences.  Danielle
purchased him a cookbook from their favorite recipe website for his
birthday and he has enjoyed making meals from it. Now Daniel is hoping
to use FastRecipes to further his burgeoning interest in cooking. He
