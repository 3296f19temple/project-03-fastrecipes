	name: vegetable scraps
	amount: n/a
	unit: n/a
	name: chicken carcass
	amount: n/a
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Pick the skin from the chicken carcass and make sure you’ve gotten all of the good meat off. Leave the cartilage as this will “melt” into the broth, adding flavor and nutrients. Yes, cartilage has nutrients. It’s like taking a joint supplement pill, but it tastes better.
step 1:
Make sure your vegetable scraps are clean by rinsing well with cool water. You can use the ends and stems of carrots, celery, herbs, onion skins, or any piece of a vegetable that you normally cut off and throw away. The vegetables WILL effect the flavor, so make sure you use vegetables that “go” together. I used celery, carrots, parsley stems, and onion skins.
step 2:
Add the chicken carcass and vegetable scraps to a large pot and cover with water (about 12 cups, depending on how big your chicken was and how many scraps you have). Bring up to a boil over med-high heat, then reduce to low and let simmer with a lid for 3-4 hours.
step 3:
After simmering, pour the broth through a colander into a large bowl or pot. Remove the colander and throw away all of the scraps. Cover the colander with a cheese cloth or another clean, lint-free cloth and pour the broth through once more to remove small particles.
step 4:
Divide the broth into smaller containers to help facilitate cooling. Refrigerate until cold and then transfer to the freezer, remembering to label and date each container.

num_servings: 4
ingredients:
	name: butter
	amount: 2
	unit: Tbsp
	name: garlic
	amount: 2
	unit: cloves
	name: chicken broth*
	amount: 2
	unit: cups
	name: whole milk
	amount: 1.5
	unit: cups
	name: fettuccine
	amount: 8
	unit: oz
	name: sun dried tomatoes
	amount: 12
	unit: pieces
	name: Freshly cracked pepper
	amount: n/a
	unit: n/a
	name: grated Parmesan
	amount: 1/4
	unit: cup
step 0:
Cut the sun dried tomatoes into small pieces and set aside. Mince the garlic and sauté it with butter in a deep skillet over medium heat for 1-2 minutes, or just until it's soft and fragrant (don't let it brown).
step 1:
Add the chicken broth, milk, fettuccine (I like to break it in half first), sun dried tomato pieces, and a healthy dose of freshly cracked pepper (15-20 cranks of a pepper mill) to the skillet. Make sure the pasta is submerged below the liquid.
step 2:
Place a lid on the pasta and allow the liquid in the skillet to come to a boil. Once it reaches a boil, give it a quick stir to make sure the pasta is not stuck to the bottom. Return the lid to the top, turn the heat down to low (or just above low), and let it simmer for about 10-12 minutes, or until the pasta is tender. Stir briefly every 4-5 minutes as it simmers to keep the pasta from sticking to the bottom of the skillet.
step 3:
If the pasta is still very soupy at that point, remove the lid and let it simmer for 3-5 minutes more, or until the sauce has reduced and thickened slightly. Once thickened, sprinkle the Parmesan over top and serve. The sauce will continue to thicken after the pasta is removed from the heat.

ingredients:
	name: large russet potatoes (about 2 lbs.)
	amount: 2

	name: cooking oil, or as needed
	amount: 4
	unit: Tbsp
	name: Seasoning salt to taste 
	amount: n/a
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Peel the potatoes, if desired. Use a large-holed cheese grater or food processor to shred the potatoes. Place the potatoes in a colander and rinse well, or until the water runs clear. Let the potatoes drain.
step 1:
Squeeze the potatoes of their excess water by pressing against the side of the colander or squeezing in your fist. Or, place the potatoes in a clean, lint-free dish towel, roll them up, then press to remove excess moisture.
step 2:
Heat a large cast iron or non-stick skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add a tablespoon of cooking oil. Tilt the skillet to spread the oil over the surface. Add about 1/3 of the shredded potatoes or enough to cover the surface of the skillet in a solid, yet thin layer (1/2 inch thick or so). Let the potatoes fry, without disturbing, until deeply golden brown on the bottom (3-5 minutes). Season lightly with seasoning salt.
step 3:
Flip the potatoes, and drizzle with additional oil if needed. Let the potatoes cook on the second side without disturbing until golden brown and crispy again. Season lightly on the second side.
step 4:
If needed, flip and cook one more time to achieve the ratio of brown to white that you like. Repeat the process until all of the potatoes are cooked. Serve hot.

	unit: tsp
	name: water
	amount: 8
	unit: cups
	name: salt, or to taste
	amount: 1/2
	unit: tsp
step 0:
Turn the Instant Pot on to Sauté mode. Add the chicken carcass pieces and sauté for 2-3 minutes, or until browned and pieces begin to stick to the bottom of the pot. Press the cancel button to turn off the heat.
step 1:
Cut the ends off the onion, then cut it in half or into quarters. Remove any of the papery skin if it has dirt on it, otherwise leave the skin on. Scrub the carrots and celery. Cut them in half so they fit easily within the pot. Peel the garlic cloves and add them to the pot with the bay leaves, some freshly cracked pepper (or 10-15 whole peppercorns, if available), and a splash of apple cider vinegar.
step 2:
Pour 8 cups of cool water over the contents of the pot (do not fill more than 2/3 to the top). Lock the lid into place, close the steam release valve, and press the "manual" button. The display will show 30, indicating the default time set for that mode. We want it to cook for 30 minutes, so no need to adjust the time. After 10 seconds the display will turn to "ON" indicating that it is heating and pressure is building (this takes about 10-15 minutes).
step 3:
Once the pot has reached high pressure, the display will begin to count down 30 minutes. When 30 minutes is up, it will beep and switch to "keep warm" mode. Press the cancel button and allow the pressure in the pot to reduce naturally (this takes about 15 minutes). You'll know the pressure is at a safe level and it's okay to open the pot when the silver float valve on the lid has fallen down and is no longer elevated. Open the steam release valve, then carefully open the lid.
step 4:
Place a fine wire mesh strainer over a large bowl, then ladle the stock into the bowl through the strainer to catch any pieces. When the level gets too low to ladle, remove the large pieces and carefully pour the remaining liquid through the strainer. Taste the stock and add salt if desired.
step 5:
Place the stock in an air-tight container and refrigerate until completely cool. Keep the stock refrigerated and use within three days, or freeze for longer storage.

	unit: cup
	name: Italian seasoning blend 
	amount: 1
	unit: Tbsp
	name: large egg 
	amount: 1
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Rinse and dry the zucchini. Cut the ends off and then cut each one into strips, approximately 1/3 inch thick.
step 1:
Place the zucchini strips on a large zip top bag and add the flour and salt. Shake the bag to coat the zucchini in flour. In a wide, shallow bowl combine the panko bread crumbs, parmesan cheese, and Italian seasoning. Stir to combine. In a second wide, shallow bowl, whisk a raw egg with about 1 Tbsp of water until fairly smooth.
step 2:
Begin to preheat your oven to 425 degrees. Cover a baking sheet with foil and then place two wire cooling racks over top. One by one, take the flour coated zucchini strips and dip them in the egg and then the seasoned bread crumb mixture. Place the breaded zucchini on the wire cooling racks. The wire racks keep the zucchini up off of the baking sheet and allows hot air to circulate underneath, which will prevent soggy bottoms. Also make sure there is a small amount of space between each strip to allow circulation.
step 3:
Once all of the zucchini strips are breaded, bake them for approximately 15 minutes or until they are a medium golden brown color. Cooking time will vary with the thickness of your zucchini strips, so keep a close eye.

	unit: cups
	name: parsley, chopped, for garnish
	amount: 2
	unit: Tbsp 
step 0:
Preheat the oven to 425ºF. Dice the zucchini and yellow squash. Reserve 1/4 of the red onion for the meatballs and cut the remaining 3/4 into 1-inch slices. Place the chopped zucchini, squash, onion, and grape tomatoes on a large baking sheet.
step 1:
Drizzle the olive oil over the vegetables, then add the garlic powder, oregano, salt and pepper. Use your hands to toss the vegetables in the oil and spices until they are evenly coated. Spread the vegetables out evenly over the baking sheet, then transfer them to the oven.
step 2:
Roast the vegetables in the oven for 40 minutes, or until they are wilted and browned on the edges, stirring once half way through.
step 3:
While the vegetables are roasting, prepare the meatballs. Mince the remaining 1/4 red onion. Add the ground beef, red onion, minced garlic, chopped parsley, oregano, cumin, cloves, cinnamon, and salt to a bowl. Mix the ingredients together until they are well combined.
step 4:
Shape the meat mixture into 16 ping pong sized meatballs. This is a good time to begin cooking your rice so that it's finished at the same time as the meatballs and vegetables.
step 5:
Heat a large non-stick or cast iron skillet over medium heat. Once hot, 1 Tbsp cooking oil and swirl to coat the surface of the skillet. Add half of the meatballs and cook on each side until well browned (about 7 minutes total). Be careful as you turn the meatballs, as they can be quite delicate. If it's easier, you can flatten them into mini patty shapes. Transfer the cooked meatballs to a clean plate, add more oil to the skillet, and cook the second batch in the same manner.
step 6:
Once the meatballs are cooked and the vegetables have finished roasting, it's time to assemble the meal. Place about 1 cup cooked rice on each plate or container, add 1/4 of the roasted vegetables, then top with four of the beef kofta meatballs. Top with a little more chopped parsley and enjoy!

To yield about 4 cups white rice, I use 1.5 cups uncooked rice and 2.5 cups water, but this may vary depending on your rice variety, so be sure to check the package.
step 1:
While the rice is cooking, add the ground turkey or beef to a skillet and cook over medium heat until it is cooked through. Depending on the fat content of your meat, you may need to add a little oil to the skillet to keep it from sticking.
step 2:
Once the meat is fully cooked, add the taco seasoning and 1/2 cup water. Stir and simmer the meat and spices until the water reduces to a saucy consistency (about 5 minutes). Turn the heat off and set the meat aside.
step 3:
Thaw the corn kernels, rinse and drain the black beans, shred the cheese, and slice the green onions.
step 4:
Once the rice is finished, fluff it with a fork and divide it between four containers. Divide the remaining six bowl ingredients between the containers as well (taco meat, corn, beans, cheese, salsa, and green onions). 
step 5:
Reheat the bowls for 1-2 minutes before eating to melt the cheese and heat the meat and rice through.

step 0:
Finely dice the onion and mince the garlic. Add both to a large soup pot with the olive oil and sauté over medium heat until the onions are soft (about 5 minutes). Add the ground beef and continue to sauté until browned. If using a higher fat content beef, drain the fat once the beef has browned.
step 1:
Add the shredded cabbage, stewed tomatoes (with juices), oregano, basil, some freshly cracked pepper (I like it peppery, so about 20 cranks of a pepper mill), the beef broth and Worcestershire sauce. Stir everything to combine.
step 2:
Place a lid on the pot, turn the heat up to high, and let it come to a boil. Once boiling, turn the heat down to low and allow it to simmer for about 30 minutes, or until the cabbage is very soft.
step 3:
Taste the soup and add salt if needed (I did not add salt, but you may need to depending on the type of broth you use). Use a spoon to break any larger pieces of tomato into smaller pieces. Squeeze about 1 Tbsp of lemon juice into the soup and add a handful of chopped fresh parsley. Stir to combine, taste once more and make adjustments if needed, then serve.

	amount: 1.5
	unit: cups
	name: Butter and flour for coating the muffin tin
	amount: n/a
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Use a zester or small holed cheese grater to remove the zest from the orange. Squeeze as much juice from the orange as possible. You'll need at least 1/2 cup, but no more than 3/4 cup juice. Set the zest and juice aside until they are needed. Preheat the oven to 350ºF.
step 1:
Create the streusel first so it's ready to go on the muffins as soon as the batter is mixed. In a small bowl stir together the brown sugar, white sugar, 1/4 tsp of the orange zest, salt, and melted butter. Once mixed, add the flour and stir to combine again until the flour creates a sort of paste with the butter and sugar. Set the streusel aside.
step 2:
In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt for the muffin batter. Once mixed, add the butter in chunks and work it into the dry ingredients until the mixture is crumbly.
step 3:
In a small bowl or measuring cup, combine the egg with 3/4 cup orange juice and whisk until the egg is incorporated. If you have slightly less than 3/4 juice from the orange, you can top it off with water to make 3/4 cup, but make sure you have at least 1/2 cup juice to maintain the flavor.
step 4:
Pour the juice and egg mixture into the bowl with the dry ingredients, and stir just until the mixture has moistened. Do not over stir. Add the cranberries (whole or chopped) and fold them into the batter.
step 5:
Use about 1/2 Tbsp butter to coat the inside wells of a 12 muffin tin. Once coated in butter, spoon a little flour in each well and then tilt the tin until the flour coats all sides of each well. Dump out any excess flour.
step 6:
Divide the muffin batter between the 12 wells in the muffin tin, then top with a generous sprinkle of the streusel topping (make sure it's in clumps). Bake the muffins for about 30 minutes, or until the muffins are golden brown on top. Let the muffins cool before loosening and removing them from the tin.

step 0:
Dice the onion and mince the garlic. Cook both in a large pot with olive oil over medium heat until soft and transparent (about 5 minutes).
step 1:
Add the chicken breast, V8 juice, diced tomatoes, beans (drained), corn, chili powder, cumin, and oregano. Stir to combine. Open the can of chipotle peppers and take two out. Mince them and add to the pot. Take two spoonfuls of the adobo sauce from the can and add to the pot as well. Stir it on up.
step 2:
Bring the pot up to a boil over medium-high heat with a lid. Once reaches a boil, reduce the heat to low and let the pot simmer for one hour (lid on).
step 3:
After an hour, carefully remove the chicken breast and shred the meat using two forks. Return the shredded meat to the pot. Give the chili a taste and add more chipotle peppers if desired. Add salt as needed. I added about one teaspoon of salt, but this will depend on how salty your beans were, so start with a little and add more as needed.

	amount: 2
	unit: Tbsp
	name: sliced almonds
	amount: 2
	unit: Tbsp
step 0:
Rinse the quinoa well in a fine wire mesh sieve. Add the quinoa, 1/8 tsp salt, and 3/4 cup water to a small sauce pot. Place a lid on top and bring it up to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, turn the heat down to low and let it simmer for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes the quinoa should be tender. Spread the quinoa out over a tray or baking dish, then place it in the refrigerator to cool for about 10 minutes.
step 1:
While the quinoa is cooking, prepare the lemon turmeric dressing. In a bowl or jar, combine the almond butter, hot water (start with 2 Tbsp), lemon juice, ground ginger, ground turmeric, sugar, salt, and pepper (about 5 cranks of a pepper mill). Stir very well until the almond butter fully combines with the liquid and the mixture is smooth. Add more water, if needed, to make the dressing smooth and pourable (I used 3 Tbsp total). Place the dressing in the refrigerator until ready to use.
step 2:
Thinly slice the Granny Smith apple.
step 3:
To build the salads, place 2 cups of baby greens in each large bowl. Add half of the apples slices to each, then spoon about 1/2 cup cooked and cooled quinoa over top. Sprinkle one tablespoon each of dried cranberries and sliced almonds on each salad. Finally, drizzle the lemon turmeric dressing on top, and serve.

	name: medium cheddar, shredded
	amount: 4
	unit: oz.
	name: green onions*, sliced
	amount: 3
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Dice the onion and add it to a soup pot along with the olive oil. Sauté the onion over medium heat for about 5 minutes, or until softened.
step 1:
Peel and dice the potatoes into 1-inch cubes. Cut the cauliflower into small florets. Add the cubed potatoes and cauliflower florets to the soup pot along with the vegetable broth. Place a lid on top, turn the heat up to high, and bring the pot up to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low and let it simmer for about 20 minutes, or until the potatoes and cauliflower are extremely soft.
step 2:
Add the evaporated milk to the soup. Use an immersion blender to purée the mixture, or allow it to cool slightly, then transfer the soup in batches to a blender to purée. Blending hot liquids is extremely dangerous, so make sure to let it cool until warm first (adding the evaporated milk will help bring the temperature down), and drape a towel over the lid of the blender as added protection against unintended splatter.
step 3:
Once the soup is puréed, season with smoked paprika, salt, and freshly cracked pepper (10-15 cranks of a pepper mill). The amount of salt needed will vary, depending on the salt content of the broth used.
step 4:
Place the soup back over medium heat and allow it to heat through. Once hot, begin stirring in the cheese, one handful at a time, until it has fully melted into the soup. 
step 5:
Serve the Cheesy Cauliflower and Potato Soup with sliced green onions on top.

Preheat the oven to 400ºF. Wash and chop the tomatoes, zucchini, bell pepper, and red onion into 1 to 1.5-inch pieces. Peel four cloves of garlic but leave them whole.
step 1:
Toss the chopped vegetables and garlic with 2 Tbsp of olive oil. Spread them out on a baking sheet so they are in a single layer. Sprinkle a couple pinches of salt and pepper over the vegetables
step 2:
Place the vegetables in the oven and roast at 400ºF for about 45 minutes, stirring twice throughout, until the vegetables are wilted and browned on the edges.
step 3:
While the vegetables are roasting, cook the couscous. Add the vegetable broth to a sauce pot, place a lid on top, and bring to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, add the couscous, turn off the heat, and cover the pot with the lid once again. Let the couscous sit, undisturbed, for ten minutes. Then, fluff with a fork.
step 4:
After the vegetables are finished roasting, collect the four garlic cloves, and chop them well. They will be quite soft. Also roughly chop the fresh parsley.
step 5:
Combine the couscous, roasted vegetables (including garlic), and parsley in a bowl, and stir to combine. Season with more salt and pepper if desired. Serve warm or cold!

	name: milk 
	amount: 1
	unit: cup
step 0:
Preheat the oven to 400ºF. Roughly chop or crush the rosemary to prevent large, sharp pieces. In a large bowl, combine the dry ingredients (flour, baking powder, salt, rosemary, pepper, sugar) until well combined.
step 1:
Take the butter out of the refrigerator just prior to using it. Slice the butter into pieces, then add them to the dry ingredients. Work the butter into the flour mixture until no large pieces remain and it looks a little like damp sand. I use my hands for this, but you can also use a pastry cutter.
step 2:
Starting with 3/4 cup, add just enough milk to moisten the mixture into a thick, slightly sticky dough (see photos below). There should be no dry flour left on the bottom of the bowl, but the dough should not be so wet that it appears glossy. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and scoop 8 dollops of the biscuit dough onto the paper (about 1/3 to 1/2 cup each).
step 3:
Bake the biscuits in the fully preheated 400ºF oven for 18-22 minutes or until they are golden brown on the edges. Serve warm.

step 0:
First prepare the enchilada sauce. In a medium sauce pot combine the vegetable oil, flour, and chili powder. Heat the mixture over a medium flame until it begins to bubble. Whisk and cook the bubbling paste for 1-2 minutes. Slowly pour in the water while whisking. Add the tomato paste, cumin, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, cocoa powder, and salt. Whisk until smooth and continue to heat over a medium flame. Let the sauce come up to a gentle simmer, at which point the sauce will thicken. Once thickened, turn off the heat and set the sauce aside.
step 1:
Preheat the oven to 350ºF. Drain and rinse the can of beans, then add them to a large bowl. Cube the avocado, dice the tomato, slice the green onion, and pull a handful of cilantro leaves from their stems. Add them all to the bowl, along with the frozen corn kernels. Stir everything together. Season with a little salt and garlic powder.
step 2:
Coat a casserole dish with non-stick spray. Fill each tortilla with about 1/3 cup of filling and roll tightly. Place the filled tortillas in the casserole dish, seam side down. Once all of the filled enchiladas are in the dish, pour the enchilada sauce over top.
step 3:
Bake the enchiladas in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until they’re heated through and the sauce is bubbly along the edges. Top with any remaining cilantro and enjoy!

step 0:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Thaw and squeeze the spinach dry. Add the stuffing, turkey, and spinach to a bowl, then stir lightly to combine without breaking up the stuffing too much.
step 1:
Liberally coat each well in a muffin tin with non-stick spray (or butter). Divide the stuffing mixture between all 12 cups. Leave the stuffing loosely packed in the cups so that the egg mixture can fill in the empty spaces.
step 2:
In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, salt, and pepper. Divide the egg mixture among the 12 cups, filling each about 1/2 to 3/4 full. The eggs and stuffing mixtures will expand during cooking, so try not to over fill.
step 3:
Bake the muffins for 25-30 minutes or until lightly golden brown and crispy on the top. Allow the muffins to cool slightly, then run a knife around the edges to loosen and remove each muffin.

	unit: oz.
	name: spring mix or baby romaine*
	amount: 2
	unit: oz.
	name: salad dressing*
	amount: 1/2
	unit: cup
step 0:
Cook the chicken first, to ensure it has time to cool before you build your salads. Warm chicken will cause the greens to wilt prematurely. Cover the chicken with plastic, then pound with a rolling pin until it an even thickness. This will help the breast cook evenly. Season both sides of the chicken breast with salt, pepper, and smoked paprika.
step 1:
Heat 1 Tbsp cooking oil in a skillet over medium heat, then swirl to coat the surface of the skillet in oil. Add the chicken to the skillet and cook on each side for 5-7 minutes, or until it is well browned on the outside and cooked through. Transfer the chicken to a clean cutting board, let it rest for five minutes, then dice it into small pieces. Place the chopped chicken in a bowl and refrigerate while you prepare the rest of the ingredients.
step 2:
Add one inch of water in a pot, place a lid on top, then bring to a boil over high heat. Place four large eggs in a steaming basket, and once the water is boiling, carefully lower the basket into the pot. Replace the lid on top and allow the eggs to steam for 12 minutes. After 12 minutes, transfer the steaming basket and eggs to a bowl full of ice water to cool.
step 3:
Place four slices of bacon in a skillet and cook over medium heat until brown and crispy (I used the same skillet that was used for the chicken). Once fully browned, transfer to a paper towel covered plate to drain.
step 4:
To build the salads:  Place 2 Tbsp dressing on the bottom of your container. Next, layer the chickpeas, tomatoes, and chopped chicken. Peel the eggs, slice or cut them into quarters, and add them to the dish. Crumble the bacon over top, followed by the cheese. Lastly, place a couple handfuls of fresh greens on top. Be sure not to pack it too tightly. Allowing air-flow will help keep the greens fresh.
step 5:
The salads will keep about four days (depending on your specific ingredients, containers, and refrigerator environment). To serve, simply stir the salad or shake the closed container to distribute the dressing throughout.

	name: cooked jasmine rice*
	amount: 4
	unit: cups
	name: frozen broccoli florets
	amount: 1
	unit: lb.
step 0:
Begin by mixing together the sesame sauce. In a medium bowl, stir together the soy sauce, 2 Tbsp water, sesame oil, brown sugar, rice vinegar, grated ginger, minced garlic, sesame seeds, and cornstarch until the cornstarch is dissolved. Set the sauce aside.
step 1:
Cut the brick of tempeh into 8 squares, then cut each square diagonally into a triangle. Turn each triangle on its side and slice it in half so you have two thinner triangles. To achieve the proper tempeh to sauce ratio, you don't want thick pieces. 
step 2:
Place the tempeh in a large skillet and add 1/2 cup water. Place the skillet over medium-high heat and let the tempeh simmer until all of the water evaporates (about 5-8 minutes). Flip the tempeh a couple times as it simmers.
step 3:
Once the water has evaporated, turn the heat down to medium and pour in the sesame sauce. The skillet will still be quite hot, so the sauce may begin to thicken immediately. Stir the tempeh in the sauce until the sauce has thickened (1-2 minutes), then remove it from the heat immediately to prevent further evaporation and thickening.
step 4:
To build the bowls, place one cup of rice in each dish, top with 1/4 of the sesame tempeh, 1/4 of the broccoli florets, and a sprinkle of green onion.

	name: vegetable broth
	amount: 6
	unit: cups
	name: fresh greens*
	amount: 12
	unit: oz.
step 0:
The night before, place the black eyed peas in a large bowl or container and fill with cool water (there should be at least three times as much water as peas). Allow the peas to soak overnight in the refrigerator.
step 1:
When you're ready to begin cooking, add the olive oil to a large pot. Dice the onion, mince the garlic, and slice the celery. Add the onion, garlic, and celery to the pot and sauté over medium heat until the onions are transparent. 
step 2:
Drain the soaked peas in a colander and rinse them with cool water. Add the rinsed peas to the pot with the vegetables. Also add the oregano, smoked paprika, cayenne pepper, some freshly cracked pepper (about 20 cranks of a pepper mill), bay leaf, and vegetable broth. Stir to combine.
step 3:
Add a lid to the pot, turn the heat up to high, and bring the pot to a boil. Once it reaches a boil, turn the heat down to low, and allow it to simmer for 1 hour.
step 4:
After one hour of simmering, the black eyed peas should be tender. Add the greens to the pot and stir them in until wilted. Smash some of the peas against the side of the pot as you stir to help thicken the liquid. 
step 5:
Turn the heat up to medium to bring the pot back up to a simmer, and allow the peas and greens to simmer for 30 minutes more, without a lid. After simmering for 30 minutes, the greens should be tender and the peas should have broken down further and thickened the liquid even more. Taste the peas and add salt to your liking (I added about 3/4 tsp, but the amount needed will depend on the salt content of your vegetable broth). Serve with crusty bread or over rice.

step 0:
Remove your tofu from the package and place it between two plates or rimmed baking sheets. Place something heavy on top, like a cast iron skillet, to weigh it down and press out the excess liquid. Let the tofu press for about 30 minutes. Pour off the liquid and pat the tofu dry with a paper towel.
step 1:
Roughly chop the block of tofu into small, irregular shapes. Place the chopped tofu in a bowl and sprinkle with salt and 1 Tbsp cornstarch. Fold the tofu and cornstarch together until coated, then add a second tablespoon of cornstarch and fold again.
step 2:
Heat the cooking oil in a large non-stick skillet (cast iron or teflon, your choice) over medium. Once hot, add the cornstarch coated tofu. Allow the tofu to cook until golden brown on the bottom, then stir and let cook until golden brown on bottom again. Repeat this process until most of the tofu is golden and crispy on the edges (about 10 minutes total), then remove it from the heat.
step 3:
Add the hoisin sauce to the fried tofu and stir to coat. Slice the green onion and shred the carrot. Roughly chop the peanuts.
step 4:
To build the lettuce cups, spoon 1-2 Tbsp cooked rice into each lettuce leaf, top with 1-2 Tbsp of the hoisin tofu, then sliced green onion, shredded carrot, and chopped peanuts. Enjoy!

	amount: 1/4
	unit: lb.
	name: Caesar dressing
	amount: 1/4
	unit: cup
step 0:
Preheat the oven to 425ºF. Spray or brush a thin layer of oil onto a large sheet pan.
step 1:
Slice the potatoes into 1/2 to 3/4-inch pieces. Place them in a bowl, add 1 Tbsp olive oil, the oregano, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Toss the potatoes until they are coated in oil and seasoning, then spread them onto half of the sheet pan.
step 2:
Add the tomatoes to the same bowl used for the potatoes, add another tablespoon of olive oil and another pinch of salt and pepper. Toss the tomatoes until they are coated and spread them out on the other half of the sheet pan.
step 3:
Roast the potatoes and tomatoes for 20 minutes. While the potatoes and tomatoes are roasting, prepare the chicken. Place the chicken breasts on a cutting board and cover with a sheet of plastic wrap. Use a rolling pin or mallet to pound the chicken until it is an even thickness, about 1/2-inch thick. Slice each chicken breast into two pieces. Place the chicken in the oiled bowl used for the potatoes and tomatoes, add another tablespoon of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper. Toss the chicken until it is coated, then set aside.
step 4:
After roasting for 20 minutes, stir the potatoes and tomatoes, keeping them separate, and then push each to the side slightly, opening the center of the sheet pan for the chicken. Place the chicken on the sheet pan, then return the pan to the oven and roast everything for an additional 20 minutes.
step 5:
After 20 minutes, use a meat thermometer to make sure your largest piece of chicken has reached 165ºF at its thickest point.
step 6:
Spread 1 Tbsp pesto over top of each piece of chicken. Slice the mozzarella into thick slices, then place one over each piece of chicken. Change the setting on the oven from bake to broil and return the sheet pan to the oven. Let the chicken broil for 3-5 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and slightly browned. Watch the chicken closely as it broils because it will cook very quickly under the broiler.
step 7:
Toss the spring mix with the dressing, then divide between four plates. Add one piece of pesto chicken to each plate, then top the chicken with a few of the roasted tomatoes. Divide the roasted potatoes between the four plates, then serve.

	name: lemon
	amount: 1
	unit: n/a
	name: Salt and Pepper to taste
	amount: n/a
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Bring a pot of water to a boil for the pasta. Once boiling, add the pasta and continue to boil until the pasta is tender. Reserve about 1/2 cup of the starchy cooking water, then drain the pasta and set it aside.
step 1:
While the pasta is cooking, prepare the asparagus. Remove the bottom 1/2 to 1-inch of the stems, or just the part that is tough and woody. Chop the remaining asparagus into 1-inch pieces.
step 2:
Place the asparagus in a large skillet and add about 1/2 inch water. Place a lid on the skillet and bring the water up to a boil. Let the asparagus steam and simmer for about 2 minutes, or just until it turns bright green and has become slightly tender (test with a fork). Drain the asparagus and return it to the skillet.
step 3:
Add the butter and minced garlic to the skillet with the asparagus and place it over medium heat. Sauté the partially cooked asparagus in the butter and garlic for about two minutes more, or until the garlic becomes soft and fragrant. Turn off the heat.
step 4:
Add the cooked and drained pasta to the skillet with the sautéed asparagus. Toss the pasta in the skillet until it is combined with the asparagus and coated with garlic butter. Top with a generous pinch of salt and freshly cracked pepper.
step 5:
Use a zester or small-holed cheese grater to zest the lemon onto the pasta. Once zested, slice the lemon in half and squeeze the fresh juice over the pasta. Toss the pasta until everything is well combined, adding a splash of the reserved pasta cooking water if it becomes dry. Taste the pasta and adjust the salt, pepper, or lemon if desired. Serve warm.

	unit: tsp
	name: heavy cream**
	amount: 1/2
	unit: cup
	name: soy sauce
	amount: 1
	unit: tsp
step 0:
Wash the mushrooms to remove any dirt or debris. Slice half of the mushrooms and roughly chop the other half.
step 1:
Add the olive oil, mushrooms, garlic, and a pinch of salt and pepper to a soup pot. Sauté the mushrooms over medium heat until they have released all of their moisture, all the liquid has evaporated from the bottom of the pot, and the mushrooms become very dark brown.
step 2:
Add the butter and flour to the pot. Stir and cook for about two minutes more. The flour and butter will form a thick paste and coat the mushrooms and the bottom of the pot. It's okay for the flour to coat the pot and brown a bit, just don't let it burn.
step 3:
Finally, add the vegetable broth, water, and dried thyme. Stir to dissolve all of the flour from the bottom of the pot. Allow the liquid to come up to a simmer, at which point the flour will slightly thicken the broth.
step 4:
Stir the cream into the soup. Finally, add the soy sauce, taste the soup, and add an additional pinch of salt if needed (depending on the salt content of the broth you used). Serve hot.

ingredients:
	name: warm water
	amount: 3/4
	unit: cup
	name: active dry or instant yeast
	amount: 2
	unit: tsp
	name: sugar

	name: pepperoni
	amount: 2
	unit: oz.
	name: shredded mozzarella
	amount: 1
	unit: cup
	name: pizza sauce (for dipping, optional)
	amount: 1/2 
	unit: cup
step 0:
Combine the warm water, yeast, and sugar, and stir until the yeast is dissolved. Let the mixture sit for about five minutes or until the yeast has developed a layer of foam on top of the water.
step 1:
Meanwhile, add 1 cup of the flour to a large bowl along with the salt.
step 2:
Once the yeast has become foamy, add the olive oil to the yeast mixture, then pour the mixture into the bowl with the flour and salt. Stir until a thick batter forms. Begin to stir in more flour, a little at a time, until it forms a ball of dough that you can no longer stir with a spoon.
step 3:
Turn the ball of dough out onto a clean surface dusted with flour. Knead the dough, adding a small amount of flour as you go, for about five minutes. You should have used around 2 cups flour total from the very beginning, give or take a little.
step 4:
Place the kneaded dough back in the bowl, cover it loosely, and let it rise until double in volume. Once doubled, begin preheating the oven to 400ºF.
step 5:
Punch the dough down, scrape it out of the bowl, and onto a floured surface. Stretch the dough out into roughly shaped rectangle, approximately 10x16 inches. Try to avoid using a rolling pin, if possible, as this will compress the dough and prevent it from being nice and fluffy.
step 6:
Once shaped, spread the pesto over the surface of the dough from edge to edge. scatter the sliced pepperoni over the surface, then sprinkle half of the cheese on top.
step 7:
Roll the dough up into a log, then use a very shape knife to slice it into 8 (or more) equal sized slices. Place the sliced rolls in a casserole dish that has been coated in non-stick spray (or oil if you prefer). Make sure to use a dish large enough to allow the rolls room to expand as they bake. Sprinkle the remaining cheese over top of the rolls in the dish, allowing some to fall around the edges and between the rolls.
step 8:
Bake the Pesto Pizza Rolls in the preheated oven for about 30 minutes, or until they are puffed up, golden brown on top, and the pesto and cheese are bubbling around the edges. Serve warm with pizza sauce for dipping.

step 0:
Place the rice in a large pot and add 3 cups water. Place a lid on the pot and bring it up to a boil over high heat. Once it reaches a boil, turn the heat down to low and let it simmer for 15 minutes. After simmering for 15 minutes, turn the heat off and let the rice rest without removing the lid for an additional 5 minutes. (OR use your favorite method of cooking rice -- rice cooker, Instant Pot, etc.)
step 1:
While the rice is cooking, chop the broccoli florets into tiny pieces.
step 2:
Once the rice has cooked, fluff it gently with a fork. Add the butter, salt, garlic powder, cayenne, and some freshly cracked pepper. Fold the butter and spices into the rice until fairly well combined (the butter should melt quickly in the hot rice).
step 3:
Add the chopped broccoli and gently fold it into the rice. The broccoli should bring the temperature of the rice down just to the point where it is hot/warm, but not so hot that the cheese immediately melts when stirred into the rice.
step 4:
Finally, add the Parmesan and cheddar cheeses, and fold to combine again. Taste and adjust the salt or butter if needed. Serve immediately.

step 0:
Rinse the quinoa well using a wire mesh sieve to prevent the small granules from washing away. Allow the excess water to drain away and then place the rinsed quinoa in a sauce pot.
step 1:
Add 1.75 cups water to the sauce pot with the quinoa, place a lid on top, and bring it up to a boil over high heat. Once it reaches a boil, turn the heat down to low and let it simmer for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, turn the heat off and let it rest for 5 minutes, without removing the lid. Finally, fluff with a fork and allow the quinoa to cool (I placed mine in the refrigerator for faster cooling).
step 2:
While the quinoa is cooking, prepare the dressing. In a small bowl whisk together the olive oil, vinegar, smoked paprika, cumin, garlic powder, salt, and freshly cracked pepper. Set the dressing aside.
step 3:
Rinse and drain the black beans. Dice the bell peppers, and slice the green onions.
step 4:
Combine the beans, bell peppers, green onions, and cooled quinoa in a large bowl. Pour the dressing over top, and stir until everything is evenly mixed and coated in dressing. Taste and adjust the salt if needed. Serve immediately or refrigerate until ready to eat. Make sure to stir the salad well before serving.

	unit: oz.
	name: Roma tomatoes
	amount: 2
	unit: n/a
step 0:
In a very small bowl or dish, stir together 1 Tbsp olive oil and the garlic powder. Let the mixture sit and infuse while you prepare the rest of the ingredients.
step 1:
To make the parsley pesto, finely mince 1 packed cup of fresh parsley leaves (about 1/2 cup once minced). Add the minced garlic, grated Parmesan, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes. Add the lemon juice and olive oil to the mixture, starting with just 1 Tbsp lemon juice and 2 Tbsp olive oil, and adding more if needed to create a mixture that is loose enough to drizzle over the pizza. I used 1.5 Tbsp lemon and 3 Tbsp oil total, but this will depend on the volume of your minced parsley. Set the parsley pesto aside.
step 2:
Move your oven's rack to the top position and begin preheating the oven to 500ºF. Thinly slice the tomatoes and fresh mozzarella.
step 3:
Stretch or roll your pizza dough out to a 14-16" disc. Place it on a pizza pan or baking sheet*. Stir the garlic and oil, then brush a thin later over the entire surface of the dough, including the outer crust.
step 4:
Arrange the tomato slices evenly over the pizza dough, then top with torn slices of mozzarella. 
step 5:
Bake the pizza in the fully preheated 500ºF oven for 10 minutes, or just until the outer crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted, but not browned. After removing the pizza from the oven, drizzle the parsley pesto over top, slice into eight pieces, and serve.

step 0:
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil for the pasta. Once boiling, add the pasta and continue to boil until the pasta is tender. Drain in a colander and let cool.
step 1:
While the pasta is cooking, prepare the pesto. Pull the kale leaves from the woody stems, and roughly chop into thin strips. Place the kale in a colander and rinse with cool water. Let the excess water drain away.
step 2:
Add the chopped and washed kale to a food processor along with the olive oil, 1/4 cup juice from the lemon, garlic, walnuts, Parmesan, salt, and pepper. Purée the mixture until smooth and bright green. Add more oil if needed to allow the mixture to become a thick, smooth sauce. Taste the pesto and adjust the salt, pepper, or lemon juice to your liking. Set the pesto aside.
step 3:
Once the pasta is drained and cooled to the point where it is no longer steaming, transfer it to a large bowl. Add about half of the pesto and stir until the pasta is coated. 
step 4:
Dice the mozzarella into small cubes, then add it to the pasta along with about 1 Tbsp of the zest from the lemon. Stir to combine with the pesto pasta. Add more pesto until everything is coated in a thick layer. Top with more freshly cracked pepper and serve, or refrigerate until ready to eat.

	unit: oz
	name: sugar
	amount: 2
	unit: tsp
	name: egg, separated
	amount: 1
	unit: large
step 0:
To prepare the galette crust, combine the flour, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Cut the cold butter into chunks and add it to the flour and salt. Use a pastry cutter or your hands to work the butter into the flour until the flour looks like damp sand with some pea-sized pieces of butter.
step 1:
Begin adding ice water, one tablespoon at a time, until a dough forms and no dry flour remains on the bottom of the bowl. Shape the dough into a flattened disc, wrap it in plastic, and refrigerate for one hour or until solid.
step 2:
While the dough is refrigerating, combine the blueberries, sugar, cornstarch, 1/2 tsp of zest and 1 Tbsp of juice from the lemon. Stir them together well and set the mixture aside.
step 3:
In a separate bowl, combine the room temperature cream cheese, sugar, egg yolk, and 1 tsp juice from the lemon until it forms a smooth mixture. Save the egg white to brush over the crust just before baking.
step 4:
Preheat the oven to 400ºF. Lightly flour a clean work surface. Take the dough out of the refrigerator and roll it into a 14-16 inch circle. The dough may seem a little stiff at first, but it will become more pliable as it warms. Make sure to keep your work surface dusted with flour as you roll to keep the dough from sticking.
step 5:
Line a large baking sheet with parchment. Transfer the rolled dough onto the parchment (you can either roll or fold the dough to transfer without ripping). Spread the cream cheese mixture over the center of the circle, leaving about 2-inches of bare dough around the outside edge. I like to leave a higher "lip" on the outer edge of the cream cheese to help hold in the berries and their juice.
step 6:
Stir the blueberries one last time and pour them over the cream cheese, including all of the juice from the bowl. Begin folding up the sides of the dough over the cream cheese and berries, leaving the center open.
step 7:
Whisk the reserved egg white with a fork, using a drop or two of water to make it more fluid, if needed. Brush the egg white over the surface of the galette dough.
step 8:
Bake the galette for 30 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown. Let the galette sit for 10 minutes before slicing into six pieces and serving.

	name: cilantro
	amount: 1/4
	unit: bunch
	name: cheese**
	amount: 4
	unit: oz
step 0:
To make the black bean sauce, combine the drained black beans, chipotle peppers plus about 1 Tbsp of the adobo sauce, 1/4 of the sweet onion (diced), cumin, and garlic in a blender or food processor. Starting with one cup, add the broth as you blend until a smooth, thick sauce forms. Taste and adjust the salt as needed (this will depend on the salt content of the broth you use).
step 1:
Preheat the oven to 350ºF. Heat the tortillas by either microwaving the stack for 30 seconds, toasting them in a skillet, or directly on a gas burner until lightly browned. Cover the stacked warmed tortillas with foil to retain the heat and steam.
step 2:
Finely dice the rest of the sweet onion. Roughly chop the cilantro leaves, add them to the diced onion along with a pinch of salt, and stir to combine. Set the onion and cilantro mixture aside to marinate.
step 3:
Pour a small amount of the black bean sauce into a casserole dish and spread it around to cover the bottom. Pour more sauce into a wide shallow bowl or dish for dipping the tortillas.
step 4:
One by one, dip the tortillas in the black bean sauce until both sides are coated in the thick sauce. Sprinkle a little cheese and a little of the onion cilantro mixture over half of the tortilla, fold it closed, then fold in half once more to make a triangle. Place the dipped, filled, and folded tortillas in the prepared casserole dish. Be careful to only place a very small amount of filling in the tortillas to make them easier to fold. More filling will be placed on top after baking.
step 5:
Once all the tortillas are dipped, filled, folded, and placed in the casserole dish, pour any remaining black bean sauce over top. Bake the tortillas in the preheated oven for about 15 minutes, or just until heated through. Top with the remaining cheese and onion cilantro mixture after baking, then serve.

step 0:
Add the olive oil and garlic to a large deep skillet and sauté over medium heat for 1-2 minutes, or until the garlic is fragrant. Add the ground turkey, oregano, salt, and pepper to the skillet. Continue to sauté until the turkey is cooked through (about 5 minutes).
step 1:
While the turkey is cooking, slice the olives and sun dried tomatoes. Once the turkey is cooked through, add the rice, frozen spinach (no need to thaw first), olives, and sun dried tomatoes to the skillet. 
step 2:
Add the chicken broth and stir until everything is very well combined. Place a lid on the skillet, turn the heat up to medium high, and allow it to come up to a boil. Once it reaches a boil, turn the heat down to low or medium low, and allow it to gently simmer for 15 minutes. Use the lowest level of heat that maintains a steady simmer in the skillet.
step 3:
After 15 minutes, give the skillet a brief stir, replace the lid quickly, turn off the heat, and allow it to sit for an additional 10 minutes.
step 4:
While the skillet is resting, zest half of the lemon and slice it into wedges. Roughly chop the parsley. Give the skillet a final fluff and stir, then top with lemon zest, parsley, and crumbled feta. Serve with lemon wedges to squeeze over top.

	amount: 1
	unit: Tbsp
	name: Active Dry or instant yeast

	unit: clove
	name: grated Parmesan
	amount: 1
	unit: Tbsp
	name: shredded cheese*
	amount: 1
	unit: cup
step 0:
Combine the warm water, sugar, and yeast in a bowl and stir until the yeast and sugar are dissolved. Let them sit for about 5 minutes, or until the mixture develops a layer of foam on top.
step 1:
While the yeast is proofing, combine 1 cup of the flour and the salt in a large bowl. Stir to combine. 
step 2:
Pour the yeast mixture and olive oil into the bowl with the flour and salt. Stir until the slurry is smooth and free of lumps. Begin adding more flour, about 1/3 cup at a time, until the mixture turns into a ball of dough (about 2 cups total flour).
step 3:
Turn the dough out onto a clean surface that is lightly dusted with flour. Knead the dough until it is smooth and no longer sticky, adding only small amounts of flour as you go (about 5 minutes total). Return the ball of dough to the mixing bowl, cover with plastic, and let sit for one hour or until double in size.
step 4:
Preheat the oven to 375ºF. Prepare a baking sheet by sprinkling a liberal amount of cornmeal over the surface (about 2 Tbsp). Punch down the risen dough, then stretch it over the baking sheet, leaving the dough about 1/4-1/2 inch thick.
step 5:
Place the butter and minced garlic in a small dish and microwave for 30 seconds or until the butter is melted. Brush the butter and garlic mixture over the surface of the dough. Sprinkle the grated Parmesan over the butter and garlic. Finally, add the shredded cheese in an even layer over everything.
step 6:
Bake the bread for about 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the cheese is melted and is just beginning to turn golden brown on the edges. Once baked, slice the Cheesy Garlic Bread down the center lengthwise, then across into ten strips, about 1-inch wide. Serve with pizza sauce for dipping.

	name: water
	amount: 1.5
	unit: cups
	name: salt
	amount: 1/4 
	unit: tsp
step 0:
Prepare the chimichurri first to allow time for the flavors to blend. Combine the olive oil, red wine vinegar, oregano, cumin, red pepper flakes, and salt in a bowl.
step 1:
Pull the parsley and cilantro leaves from the stem and finely chop them. Mince the garlic. Stir the parsley, cilantro, and garlic into the bowl with the oil, vinegar, and spices. Set the chimichurri aside.
step 2:
Cut the chicken breast into very small pieces, then season with a pinch of salt and pepper. Heat one tablespoon of olive oil in a deep skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add the chicken pieces and sauté until golden brown.
step 3:
While the chicken is browning, dice the onion. Remove the chicken pieces from the skillet once golden brown, and add the diced onion in their place. Sauté the onion until soft (about 5 minutes). 
step 4:
While the onion is sautéing, dice the tomatoes. Once the onions are soft, add the diced tomatoes and sauté for about two minutes more, or until they begin to break down.
step 5:
Add the chicken back to the skillet along with the frozen peas, uncooked rice, water, and 1/4 tsp salt. Briefly stir to combine all the ingredients.
step 6:
Place a lid on the skillet, turn the heat up to medium-high, and let it come to a boil. As soon as it reaches a boil, turn the heat down to low or medium-low, and let it simmer gently for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, turn the heat off and let it rest for 10 minutes.
step 7:
After letting the rice rest for 10 minutes, remove the lid and fluff with a fork. Pour the prepared chimichurri over the rice and fold it in to combine. Be careful not to vigorously stir the chimichurri into the rice because this will cause it to become sticky and mushy. 
step 8:
Taste the chimichurri chicken and rice and season with extra salt if needed. Top with an extra pinch of fresh parsley or cilantro for garnish, then serve.

	name: salt, or to taste
	amount: 1/2
	unit: tsp
	name: green onions, sliced
	amount: 2-3
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Dice the onion and mince the garlic. Add both to a medium sauce pot with the olive oil and sauté over medium heat for 2-3 minutes, or until the onions are soft and transparent.
step 1:
Add the peas to the pot along with the water and 1 Tbsp of jerk seasoning. Stir to combine. Place a lid on the pot, turn the heat to medium-high, and allow it to come to a boil. Once it reaches a boil, turn the heat down to medium-low, and let it simmer for 15 minutes, or until the peas are very tender.
step 2:
While the peas are simmering, prepare the pineapple salsa. Chop the pineapple into very small pieces. Finely dice the red onion. Pull the cilantro leaves from their stems and give them a rough chop. Combine the pineapple, onion, cilantro, juice from half the lime, and salt in a bowl. Stir to combine, then taste, and adjust the lime or salt if needed. Set the salsa aside.
step 3:
Once the peas are very tender, turn the heat down to low, and add the coconut milk. Stir and heat through. Smash some of the peas against the side of the pot to help thicken the mixture. Taste the peas and add more jerk seasoning and salt until they are very well seasoned. You want the peas to be heavily seasoned because once they're poured over the plain rice, the seasoning will seem diluted.
step 4:
To serve, place a cup of cooked rice in a bowl and add about 1 cup of the jerk peas with the coconut broth. Top with 1/2 cup of pineapple salsa, and a sprinkle of sliced green onions. Enjoy!

	unit: cup
	name: virgin coconut oil*
	amount: 2
	unit: Tbsp
	name: sweet chili sauce, for dipping
	amount: 3
	unit: oz
step 0:
Remove the tofu from the liquid filled package and place it between multiple layers of paper towel or a clean, lint-free dish towel. Place the wrapped tofu between two plates, cutting boards, or baking sheets and place something heavy on top (I use a kettle or pot full of water). Press the tofu for 30 minutes.
step 1:
Once the tofu has been pressed, cut the block in half. Cut each piece into three 1/4-inch thick rectangles (cut the "thickness" of the block into three). Cut each rectangle into two triangles. You should now have 12 1/4-inch thick triangles.
step 2:
Prepare two bowls for the coconut crust. In the first bowl whisk together the egg, cornstarch, water, and a pinch of salt and pepper until a smooth mixture forms. Place the unsweetened coconut in the second bowl.
step 3:
Dip each tofu triangle into the egg mixture first, making sure it is fully coated, then into the coconut flakes. Place the coconut coated triangles on the cutting board until all pieces are coated.
step 4:
Heat one tablespoon of the coconut oil in a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Once the skillet and oil are hot, add half of the coconut coated tofu triangles and cook on each side until brown and crispy. Remove the cooked tofu to a paper towel lined plate, add more coconut oil, and cook the second batch.
step 5:
Serve the crispy coconut crusted tofu with sweet chili sauce for dipping.

step 0:
Preheat the oven to 425ºF. Shred the cheddar cheese, if not purchased pre-shredded. Slice one of the jalapeños length-wise, scrape out the seeds, then dice into 1/4-inch pieces. Slice the second jalapeño into rounds, leaving the seeds intact. Slice the grape tomatoes in half.
step 1:
Add the cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt to a large bowl. Stir until they are well combined.
step 2:
In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, and cooking oil.
step 3:
Pour the liquid ingredients into the bowl of dry ingredients and stir just until a lumpy batter forms and no more dry flour remains on the bottom of the bowl. Do not over stir.
step 4:
Add 1 cup of the cheddar cheese and the diced jalapeños to the batter and gently fold until they are incorporated. Prepare a 8x8" casserole dish, a 9" pie plate, or a 10" cast-iron skillet by coating with non-stick spray or a smear of butter. Pour the batter into the dish. Sprinkle the tomato halves, the sliced jalapeño, and the remaining shredded cheddar over the top. 
step 5:
Bake the cornbread for 18-20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the center is puffed up and the cheese on top is deep golden brown. Let cool for about 5 minutes, then slice into 8 pieces and serve.

	amount: 1/2
	unit: cup
	name: feta
	amount: 2

step 0:
Prepare the vinaigrette first to allow the flavors time to blend. Add the olive oil, balsamic vinegar, minced garlic, Dijon, about 1/4 tsp salt, and some freshly cracked pepper to a jar or bowl. Whisk until the ingredients are combined, or place a lid on the jar and shake for 10-15 seconds. Set the dressing aside.
step 1:
Bring a pot of water to a boil to cook the orzo. Once boiling, add the orzo and continue to boil until tender. Drain the orzo and allow it to cool just slightly.
step 2:
While waiting for the orzo to cook, chop the sun dried tomatoes into small pieces. Place them in a bowl and cover with hot water (I used a ladle full of boiling water from the pot just before adding the pasta). Let the chopped sun dried tomatoes sit in the hot water for about 5 minutes, then drain.
step 3:
Place the baby spinach in a large bowl. Add the drained and still warm orzo to the bowl, along with the soaked sun dried tomatoes, and crumbled feta cheese. Pour the balsamic vinaigrette over top, then toss until the ingredients are combined and coated with vinaigrette. Serve immediately or refrigerate until ready to eat.

	name: loosely packed cilantro
	amount: 1
	unit: cup
	name: loosely packed parsley
	amount: 1
	unit: cup
step 0:
Add the uncooked bulgur to a sauce pot and place it over medium heat. Cook and stir the dry bulgur over medium heat for 2-3 minutes, or until it smells toasty or nutty, then remove it from the heat. Add two cups of water, stir to combine, place a lid on top, then bring it to a boil over high heat. Once it reaches a boil, turn the heat down to low and let it simmer for about 12 minutes with the lid in place. Turn the heat off and let the bulgur rest for 5 minutes.
step 1:
Remove the lid from the pot and fluff the bulgur with a fork. Allow the bulgur to cool (I like to place it in the refrigerator without a lid to cool quickly and dry slightly).
step 2:
While the bulgur is simmering, preheat the oven to 400ºF. Peel and dice the sweet potatoes into 3/4-inch cubes. Place the cubed sweet potatoes on a large baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil. Add a pinch of salt and pepper, then toss the cubes until they are coated with oil. Roast the sweet potatoes in the preheated oven for 20 minutes, give them a stir, then roast for an additional 10 minutes or until they are soft and slightly browned on the edges.
step 3:
While the sweet potatoes are roasting, prepare the green tahini sauce. Place all the ingredients in a blender or food processor, and blend until the herbs are in very small pieces and the sauce becomes a light green color. Taste and adjust the salt if needed.
step 4:
Slice the avocado and jalapeño. Rinse and drain the black beans.
step 5:
To assemble the bowls, place 3/4-1 cup cooked and cooled bulgur in each bowl. Divide the sweet potatoes, black beans, avocado, and jalapeño even among the bowls. Sprinkle about 1 Tbsp pepitas over each bowl, then drizzle the green tahini sauce over everything. Be generous with the green tahini sauce as it is responsible for much of the flavor in this dish. If meal prepping, keep the green tahini sauce separate until just before serving.

ingredients:
	name: can pineapple slices in juice
	amount: 20 
	unit: oz.
	name: green onions, sliced
	amount: 2
	unit: n/a
	name: Monterey jack cheese, shredded
	amount: 2
	unit: oz.
	name: ground pork
	amount: 1
	unit: lb.
	name: teriyaki sauce, divided
	amount: 6

	name: cooking oil, divided
	amount: 1
	unit: Tbsp
	name: Onion Rolls
	amount: 4
	unit: n/a
	name: mayonnaise
	amount: 4
	unit: Tbsp
	name: sriracha
	amount: 1
	unit: Tbsp
step 0:
Take one of the pineapple slices from the can, and chop it into very small pieces. Slice the green onions and shred the Monterey Jack cheese. Place the ground pork, chopped pineapple, sliced green onions, shredded cheese, and 2 Tbsp teriyaki sauce in a large bowl. Mix the ingredients together by hand until they are evenly incorporated.
step 1:
Shape the pork mixture into four burger patties. Make the patties flatter and thinner than you'd like the finished burgers to be, as they do contract and shrink inward as they cook. Set the patties aside.
step 2:
Thinly slice the red onion. Add 1/2 Tbsp cooking oil to a large skillet and heat over medium-high. When the skillet and oil are very hot, add the red onion slices and allow them to cook until browned and caramelized on the bottom. Stir the onions and then let them brown again. Avoid stirring too often, as this will prevent the browning and caramelization on the edges. When the onions are mostly browned, transfer them to a bowl and set them aside.
step 3:
Turn the heat under the skillet down to medium, add another 1/2 Tbsp oil to the skillet, swirl to coat the surface, then add the burger patties. Cook the patties until browned on one side, then carefully flip and cook until browned on the second side and cooked through (about 5 minutes per side - cooking time may vary due to cookware and size and shape of burgers).
step 4:
While the burgers are cooking, combine the mayonnaise and sriracha in a small bowl.
step 5:
Transfer the cooked burgers to a clean plate or cutting board. Pat four more pineapple rings dry with a paper towel, then add them to the skillet. Continue to cook the pineapple slices over medium until they're hot and some of the browned bits from the skillet have dissolved off the skillet and onto the pineapple (about 2-3 minutes each side).
step 6:
To build the burgers, smear a tablespoon or so of the sriracha mayo onto a bun, add a cooked burger, and drizzle another tablespoon of teriyaki sauce over the burger. Top with one of the cooked pineapple slices and a few of the caramelized red onion.

	unit: tsp
	name: extra sharp white cheddar, shredded
	amount: 8
	unit: oz.
step 0:
Bring a pot of water to a boil for the pasta. Once boiling, add the pasta and continue to boil until tender. Add the frozen broccoli florets to the pot of boiling water and pasta, and continue to cook for 2 minutes. Drain the pasta and broccoli together in a colander.
step 1:
While the pasta is cooking, prepare the chicken. Season both sides of the chicken breast with a pinch of salt and pepper. Add one tablespoon cooking oil to a large, deep skillet and heat over medium. Once hot, swirl the oil to coat the surface of the skillet, add the chicken breast, and cook on each side until golden brown and cooked through (about 5-7 minutes per side). Remove the cooked chicken to a clean cutting board and allow it to rest for five minutes, then chop it into small cubes.
step 2:
Turn the heat under the skillet used to cook the chicken down to medium-low, and add the butter. Allow the butter to melt, and use a whisk to scrape up the browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. Pour in the evaporated milk and continue to whisk to dissolve the browned bits completely off the bottom.
step 3:
Whisk the garlic powder, smoked paprika, and salt into the evaporated milk. Once the evaporated milk is hot, begin adding the shredded white cheddar, one handful at a time, whisking until it is fully melted before adding the next handful. Once all the cheese has been whisked into the hot sauce, turn the heat down to low.
step 4:
Add the cooked and drained pasta and broccoli, and the chopped chicken to the skillet with the cheese sauce. Stir to combine and fully coat the pasta, broccoli, and chicken in the sauce, then enjoy!

	name: taco sauce
	amount: 1/2
	unit: cup
	name: large flour tortillas
	amount: 8
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Begin making the seasoned rice first, so you can prepare the rest of the ingredients as the rice cooks. Add the cooking oil and minced garlic to a sauce pot and sauté over medium for about one minute, just to take the raw edge off the garlic.
step 1:
Add the chili powder, cumin, oregano, and rice to the pot. Continue to sauté, stirring continuously, for about two more minutes to toast the rice and spices.
step 2:
Carefully add the water and salt to the pot, place a lid on top, and turn the heat up to high. Allow the pot to come up to a boil, then turn the heat down to low. Allow the pot to simmer on low for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, turn the heat off, and let the rice rest undisturbed for five more minutes. Finally, fluff the rice with a fork.
step 3:
While the rice is cooking, rinse and drain the black beans well. Slice the green onions.
step 4:
When the rice is finished cooking and you're ready to assemble the burritos, stack four tortillas on a large plate and place a damp paper towel over top. Microwave for 30 seconds to steam the tortillas, to make them more pliable and easy to roll. Steam the next four tortillas only when you're ready to begin working with them.
step 5:
To each tortilla add about 1/3 cup rice, 1/3 cup beans, 1 Tbsp taco sauce, 1/4 cup shredded cheddar, and a few slices of green onion. Roll the burritos up tightly, making sure to fold in the sides first to hold in the the filling. 
step 6:
Store the burritos in an air-tight container in the refrigerator for 4-5 days, or wrap each burrito individually in parchment paper or plastic wrap, then place in a freezer bag, and store for up to three months.
step 7:
To Cook from Refrigerated: Place the burrito in a skillet or on a grill pan and cook over medium-low heat until the outside is brown and crispy and the cheese is melted on the inside.
step 8:
To Cook from Frozen in Microwave: Set the microwave to the defrost setting for approximately 9 minutes, or the defrost by weight setting, programmed to one pound.
step 9:
To Cook from Frozen in the Oven: Wrap the burrito in foil and bake in a preheated 350ºF oven for approximately 40 minutes.

	amount: 1/2
	unit: cup
	name: solid albicore tuna, drained
	amount: 12
	unit: oz. can
step 0:
Bring a pot of water to a boil for the pasta. Once boiling, add the pasta and continue to boil until the pasta is tender. Drain the pasta in a colander.
step 1:
While the pasta is cooking, prepare the rest of the dish. Add the butter and minced garlic to a large skillet. Sauté the garlic over medium heat for about one minute, or just until it is soft and fragrant, but not browned.
step 2:
Add the frozen peas and season with a pinch of salt and pepper. Sauté for a couple minutes more, or until the peas are heated through.
step 3:
Add the half and half to the skillet and allow it to come up to a simmer, stirring frequently to keep a skin from forming on the surface or the bottom from scorching. Let the half and half simmer for about 3-5 minutes, or just until it reduces slightly. 
step 4:
At this point the pasta should be finished and drained. Add the drained pasta to the skillet and stir to combine. Sprinkle the Parmesan over the pasta and stir to combine again. Allow the heat to melt the Parmesan as you stir. Once melted, turn the heat off. Taste the pasta and add a pinch of salt and pepper, if needed.
step 5:
Finally, add the drained tuna and fold it into the pasta. If you are using whole tuna chunks, break them up slightly as you stir. If you are using chunk light tuna that is already in small pieces, fold gently to avoid breaking the tuna up too much. Serve warm!

	name: cilantro
	amount: n/a
	unit: n/a
	name: sriracha
	amount: n/a
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Dice the onion and add it to a large pot along with the butter (or coconut oil). Sauté the onion until soft and translucent (about 5 minutes).
step 1:
Once the onions are soft, add the Thai curry paste and continue to sauté for about a minute more.
step 2:
While the onion is sautéing, peel and dice the sweet potato (about 1-inch cubes). Add the sweet potato to the pot after the curry paste has sautéed, and continue to sauté the sweet potatoes while you peel and slice the carrots. Add the carrots to the pot as you slice them.
step 3:
Add the vegetable broth to the pot, stir to combine, place a lid on top, and turn the heat up to medium-high. Allow the soup to come to a boil, then turn the heat down to low (or just above low) and allow it to simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. After 30 minutes the sweet potatoes and carrots should be extremely tender and fall apart as you stir the pot.
step 4:
Turn the heat off and remove the pot from the hot stove top to facilitate cooling (to another area on the stove is fine). Add the coconut milk and stir to combine. You can reserve a tablespoon or two of the coconut milk to garnish the finished soup, if desired.
step 5:
Use an immersion blender, or allow the soup to cool further and carefully purée in batches using a traditional blender. Once the soup is puréed, give it a taste and add salt or pepper if desired (this will depend largely on the type of broth used). Garnish with fresh cilantro and a drizzle of sriracha, if desired.

	unit: oz.
step 0:
Preheat the oven to 400ºF. Dice the eggplant and zucchini into 1-inch pieces. Slice the onion into 1/2-inch strips. Place the eggplant, zucchini, onion, and grape tomatoes (whole) onto a large baking sheet.
step 1:
Sprinkle the basil, oregano, crushed red pepper, and a pinch of salt and pepper over the vegetables. Drizzle 2 Tbsp of the olive oil over top, then toss the vegetables until they are coated in oil and spices. 
step 2:
Roast the vegetables for 50 minutes, stirring every 20 minutes or so, or until they are wilted and browned on the edges, and all the grape tomatoes have burst.
step 3:
When the vegetables are almost finished roasting, add the last tablespoon of olive oil to a large oven-safe skillet. Place the skillet over medium heat and add the minced garlic. Sauté the garlic for 1-2 minutes, or just until it is soft and fragrant. Make sure to spread the oil up the sides of the skillet to help prevent the eggs from sticking.
step 4:
Add the roasted vegetables to the skillet with the garlic and stir to combine. Briefly whisk the eggs, milk, and a pinch of salt and pepper together in a separate bowl, then pour them over top of the vegetables in the skillet. Finally, top the eggs and vegetables with shredded Parmesan.
step 5:
Transfer the hot skillet to the oven (still at 400ºF) and bake the dish for about 30 minutes, or until the eggs have puffed slightly and are golden brown around the edges. The total baking time will vary slightly depending on the type of cookware and the temperature of the contents before they go in the oven.
step 6:

step 0:
Separate the whites from the yolk of ONE egg. Add the yolk to a small sauce pot along with 1 Tbsp water and about 1/2 Tbsp lemon juice (I like my hollandaise quite lemony, if you don't, start with 1 tsp lemon juice). Whisk them together until smooth. The pot is not over heat at this point.
step 1:
Cut 4 Tbsp butter into 1/2 Tbsp chunks, then place them in the sauce pot with the egg, water, and lemon juice. Finally, place the pot over LOW heat and whisk continuously, allowing the butter to slowly melt into the yolk as you whisk. It should take 2-3 minutes for the butter to melt.
step 2:
When the butter is fully melted, continue to whisk continuously and vigorously. As the mixture continues to heat, the yolk will begin to cook and solidify, which will thicken the sauce into a light, velvety mixture. It should take about 3-5 minutes for the mixture to cook to the point where it is thickened and will first look frothy, then finally begin to thicken. Once thickened, remove it from the heat. Taste the sauce and season with a pinch of salt and cayenne pepper. If you prefer more lemon, it can be whisked in at this point. Place a lid on the pot and set it near the burner that will be used for the eggs and ham, but not over direct heat, to keep it slightly warm.
step 3:
Add about 1 tsp butter to a large skillet and place it over medium heat. Allow the butter to melt, then tilt the skillet to coat the surface. Open the English muffins and place them cut sides down in the skillet. Cook them until browned, then flip an cook a couple minutes more on the other side (about 5 minutes total). Place the buttery toasted muffins on your plates.
step 4:
Wipe out the skillet to remove any cornmeal from the muffins, then add another teaspoon of butter. Once melted, add the ham slices to the skillet and cook until browned on both sides (another 3-5 minutes). If your ham slices are large like mine were, cut them in half to better fit the English muffins. Once browned, place the ham pieces on the toasted English muffins.
step 5:
Turn the heat down to medium-low, add another teaspoon of butter to the skillet and cook two of the eggs until the whites are set, but the yolks are still runny. I find using a slightly lower heat helps give the whites time to heat through and cook before cooking the yolk. Top the muffins and ham with the eggs.
step 6:
Finally, drizzle the prepared hollandaise sauce over the eggs and ham on the English muffins, and enjoy.

	name: green onions, sliced
	amount: 2
	unit: n/a
	name: large bell peppers
	amount: 3
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Preheat the oven to 350ºF. Add the chorizo to a skillet and sauté over medium heat until fully cooked. Remove it from the heat.
step 1:
Rinse and drain the black beans, then add them to the skillet, along with the diced tomatoes (with juices), cooked rice, chili powder, and salt. Stir to combine. 
step 2:
Add half of the cheese and half of the green onion to the chorizo mixture, then stir to combine.
step 3:
Slice each of the bell peppers in half and then carefully remove the white ribs and seed pods, keeping the stem intact to help hold in the stuffing. Pile the chorizo and rice mixture into each pepper, making sure to stuff it up into all the crevices, and mound it up over top. Place the peppers in a casserole dish as you fill them.
step 4:
Once all the peppers are filled, add about 1/2 inch of water to the dish to help the peppers steam and soften. Cover the dish tightly with foil, then bake for 30 minutes.
step 5:
After 30 minutes, remove the foil and top the peppers with the remaining shredded cheese. Bake for another 10 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly on the edges. Top the peppers with the remaining sliced green onion just before serving.

	name: milk
	amount: 1
	unit: cup
step 0:
Finely dice the onion, carrots, and celery. Add them all to a large soup pot with the olive oil and sauté over medium heat until the onions are soft and translucent. 
step 1:
Remove the skin from the split chicken breasts and then add the breasts and chicken broth to the pot. Place a lid on the pot, turn the heat up to medium-high, and allow it to come to a boil. Once boiling, turn the heat down to medium-low and let it simmer for 30 minutes.
step 2:
While the soup is simmering, prepare the dumplings. In a large bowl, combine the flour, salt, and baking powder, and stir until evenly combined. Add the butter and work it into the flour mixture until there are no large lumps of butter left.
step 3:
Pour the milk into the dumpling mix and stir until a sticky ball of dough forms. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead the dough 5 or 6 times, or until it is no longer sticky. Let the dough rest for about 5 minutes.
step 4:
Roll the dough out until it's about 1/8" thick, adding flour as needed to keep it from sticking, then use a pizza cutter or knife to cut it into 1x2" rectangles. Place the cut dumplings back in the bowl until you're ready to use them. Make sure they're dusted with a light coating of flour to keep them from sticking to one another.
step 5:
After the chicken breasts have simmered for 30 minutes, remove them to a cutting board. Let them cool slightly, then use two forks to remove the meat from the bone and shred it into bite-sized chunks.
step 6:
While the chicken is out of the pot, turn the heat up to medium-high and wait until it returns to a boil. Once boiling, drop in the dumplings, one by one. Let them boil in the soup, stirring occasionally, until they're all floating (about 5 minutes).
step 7:
In a separate small bowl, whisk together the 1 cup of milk and 2 Tbsp flour. Pour the mixture into the soup. Stir and cook the soup until it returns to a simmer, at which point it will thicken slightly.
step 8:
Finally, return the shredded chicken to the thickened soup, along with the frozen peas, and chopped parsley. Turn the heat off, give it a taste, and add salt or pepper if needed. Serve hot.

	amount: to taste
	unit: n/a
	name: apple cider vinegar
	amount: 2
	unit: tsp
step 0:
The night before, place the beans in a large bowl and add cool water until the beans are covered with twice as much water as the beans. Let the beans soak overnight, or for at least 8 hours, in the refrigerator.
step 1:
When you're ready to begin cooking, drain the beans in a colander and rinse them well with fresh water. Set the beans aside so they can begin to warm up.
step 2:
Mince the garlic and dice the onion. Add the garlic, onion, and coconut oil to a large soup pot. Sauté over medium heat for about 3-5 minutes, or until the onions are soft and transparent.
step 3:
While the onion and garlic are sautéing, dice the celery and carrot. Once the onions have softened, add the carrot and celery to the pot and sauté for about 5 minutes more, or just until the celery starts to soften.
step 4:
Add the beans to the pot along with 6 cups of water, and stir to combine. Place a lid on the pot, turn the heat up to medium-high, and bring it up to a boil. Once it reaches a rolling boil, turn the heat down to low or medium-low, and let the beans simmer for 90 minutes, stirring occasionally.
step 5:
After 90 minutes, the beans should be quite soft and have broken down a bit, causing the water to look slightly thick and cloudy. Add the diced tomatoes (with juices), cumin, oregano, smoked paprika, cayenne pepper, and parsley to the pot. Stir to combine, then let the soup simmer for another 20 minutes.
step 6:
Taste the soup and add salt to taste (I added 1.5 tsp). Finally, stir in the apple cider vinegar. Keep in mind that as the soup is stored in the refrigerator, the salt may absorb into the beans and taste more muted. You may need to add more salt the next day.

step 0:
Season the chicken thighs with a pinch of salt and pepper on each side.
step 1:
Heat a large skillet over medium. Once hot, add the olive oil and swirl to coat the surface of the skillet. Add the chicken thighs and cook for 5-7 minutes on each side, or until they are golden brown and cooked through. Remove the thighs to a clean plate. There should be plenty of browned bits left on the bottom of the skillet.
step 2:
Add the minced garlic and Italian seasoning blend to the skillet. Sauté the garlic and herbs in the leftover oil in the skillet. Sauté for 1-2 minutes, or just until the garlic softens a bit and becomes very fragrant.
step 3:
Pour in the chicken broth and stir, dissolving all the browned bits off the bottom of the skillet. Let the broth simmer (still over medium heat) for about 5 minutes, or until it has reduced by half.
step 4:
Once the broth has reduced, add the butter and stir until it has melted into the sauce. Add the chicken pieces back to the skillet with the sauce and spoon the sauce over each piece. Garnish with a sprinkle of chopped parsley, if desired. Serve while hot.

step 0:
Make the dressing first to allow the flavors time to blend. Add the oil, rice vinegar, soy sauce, toasted sesame oil, brown sugar, fresh grated ginger, and sesame seeds to a small jar or bowl. Whisk the ingredients together or close the jar and shake to combine. Set the dressing aside until ready to use.
step 1:
Spread the broccoli florets out on a baking sheet. Begin to preheat the oven to 400ºF. Place the baking sheet with broccoli on the stove top as the oven preheats to allow them to begin to thaw. Once the broccoli is soft enough to slice, cut any large florets into smaller bite-sized pieces. Drizzle the broccoli with 1 Tbsp oil and and pinch of salt, and toss to coat.
step 2:
Roast the broccoli for 30 minutes in the preheated oven, stirring after 20 minutes. Sprinkle the sliced almonds over the broccoli after 25 minutes, and allow them to roast together for the final five minutes. Take the broccoli and almonds out of the oven and allow them to cool (5-10 minutes).
step 3:
Once the broccoli is mostly cooled, add the crunchy lo mein noodles and sliced green onions, and stir to combine. Give the simple sesame dressing another stir or shake, and then drizzle the dressing over the baking sheet. Stir until everything is coated in dressing. Serve immediately.

Add the bread pieces to the mug and gently stir until all the pieces are saturated with the egg and milk mixture. Be careful not to stir too roughly or the bread pieces may fall apart. Let the bread sit and absorb the liquid for about 1 minute.
step 2:
Microwave the mug for 60-90 seconds, or until the mixture is solid. I have a 1250 watt microwave and find that 70-80 seconds is about perfect. You may need to experiment to find just the right cooking time for your microwave and mug size.
step 3:
Serve immediately, or deck it out with your favorite toppings.

step 0:
Finely dice the onion. Add the olive oil and onion to a large skillet and sauté over medium heat until the onion is soft and transparent (about 5 minutes). Drain, but do not rinse the black beans, allowing some of the starchy liquid to remain coating the beans. Add the beans and diced tomatoes with chiles (not drained) to the skillet, along with the chipotle powder, cumin, garlic powder, and salt. Stir and simmer the mixture until it thickens and liquid no longer pools on the bottom of the skillet (about 10 minutes).
step 1:
Begin preheating the oven to 350ºF. Shred the cheddar cheese, finely dice the Roma tomato, thinly slice the jalapeño, and chop the cilantro.
step 2:
Line a baking sheet with parchment or foil. Spread a layer of tortilla chips over the baking sheet in a single layer, trying not to overlap the chips. Spoon about half of the black bean mixture over the chips, then sprinkle half of the shredded cheese over top. Repeat with one more layer of chips, black beans, and cheese.

	amount: 3
	unit: Tbsp
	name: Pinch of flakey salt
	amount: n/a
	unit: n/a
step 0:
In a large bowl, whisk together the flour salt, sugar, and instant yeast.
step 1:
In a small bowl or liquid measuring cup, pour the boiling water over the buttermilk, stir to combine, and let cool for 10 minutes. The buttermilk may look curdled, but this is okay.
step 2:
Pour the buttermilk mixture and 2 Tbsp of the melted butter over the flour mixture. Stir until a sticky ball of dough forms. Cover the dough in the bowl with a damp tea towel or plastic wrap and set aside in a warm place for 1.5 to 2 hours, or until doubled in bulk.
step 3:
Grease an 8-inch circle or square baking dish. Using two forks, deflate the dough by releasing it from the sides of the bowl and pulling it toward the center. Rotate the bowl quarter turns as you deflate, turning the mass into a rough ball.
step 4:
Liberally flour a work surface. Use the two forks to lift the sticky ball of dough out of the bowl and onto the floured surface. Using a bench scraper or sharp knife, cut the dough into 10-12 pieces. Using well floured hands, shape each piece roughly into a circle. It's okay if each piece is a little misshapen. Place the dough balls into the prepared pan, spacing them evenly apart.
step 5:
Begin preheating the oven to 375ºF. Let the dough rise, uncovered, for 20-25 minutes, or until the dough pieces have puffed to almost fill the pan.
step 6:
Transfer the pan to the oven and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove them from the oven and immediately brush the surfaces with the remaining 1 Tbsp melted butter. Sprinkle a pinch of flakey salt over top. Let the rolls cool in the pan for 5 minutes, then turn it out onto cooling racks and invert onto a plate. Let the bread rest for 5 minutes before serving.

	name: salt 
	amount: 1/4
	unit: tsp
	name: pepper jack cheese
	amount: 4
	unit: oz
step 0:
Toast the tortillas on each side in a dry skillet over medium-low heat until they are a slightly stiff and have browned just a bit on the edges. Stack them on a plate until ready to use. Toasting the tortillas increases the flavor and helps prevent them from cracking. Shred an 8oz. block of pepper jack cheese. Half will be used for the enchilada filling and half will be used for the sauce.
step 1:
Defrost the frozen spinach in a microwave or take it out of the freezer before beginning to allow it time to defrost naturally. Squeeze as much moisture out of the thawed spinach as possible. Place the spinach in a large bowl. Rinse and drain the white beans, then add them to the bowl with the spinach. Also add 4oz. of the shredded cheese, garlic powder, cumin, salt, and a little freshly cracked pepper. Stir until the mixture is evenly combined.
step 2:
Preheat the oven to 350ºF. Begin preparing the pepper jack sauce by adding the butter and minced garlic to a small sauce pot. Sauté the garlic in the butter for one minute over medium heat. Add the milk and cream cheese to the pot. Stir and heat until the cream cheese has fully melted into the milk and the mixture has thickened slightly. Season with salt. Begin adding the remaining shredded pepper jack, a handful at a time, and stirring it in until fully melted before adding more. Once all the cheese has been melted into the sauce, turn the heat off and allow it to cool slightly.
step 3:
Coat the inside of a casserole dish with non-stick spray. Begin filling the toasted tortillas with the spinach and white bean mixture and rolling them closed. Line up the filled tortillas in the casserole dish, seam sides facing down. Choose a casserole dish that fits 12 of the rolled enchiladas snugly to help keep them from unrolling.
step 4:
Once the tortillas are filled and in the casserole dish, pour the pepper jack sauce over top. Bake the enchiladas in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, or until the edges of the tortillas are brown and the pepper jack sauce is thick and browned on the edges. Sprinkle chopped cilantro over top, if desired.

	name: cheese, shredded
	amount: 1
	unit: cup
	name: green onions, sliced
	amount: 2
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Begin the biscuit dough first, so it can rest for one hour. Dissolve the yeast into 1/4 cup hot water. Let that sit for a few minutes.
step 1:
In a large bowl, stir together the all-purpose flour, salt, baking powder, and sugar. Finally, add the heavy cream and yeast water, and stir until a sticky ball of dough forms.
step 2:
Dust the sticky dough with flour and then turn it out onto a well floured surface. Knead the dough for about three minutes, adding flour as you go to keep it from sticking. Form the dough into a ball, place it back in the bowl, cover it loosely with plastic, and let it rest for one hour.
step 3:
In the mean time, make the enchilada sauce. Add the oil, flour, and chili powder to a small sauce pot. Whisk the ingredients together and place over a medium burner. Allow the mixture to begin to sizzle and bubble, and continue to cook and whisk for about one minute.
step 4:
Carefully whisk in the water, tomato paste, cumin, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper. Allow the mixture to come up to a simmer again, at which point it will thicken. Remove it from the heat and add salt to taste. 
step 5:
Drain the black beans and add them to a bowl along with the cooked chicken. Add the enchilada sauce and stir them together until everything is coated.
step 6:
After the dough has been resting for one hour, begin to preheat the oven to 375ºF. Coat an 8x11" or 2 quart casserole dish with non-stick spray.
step 7:
Take the dough out of the bowl and place it on a well floured surface. Press it down into a circle or rectangle, and then cut it into small, bite-sized pieces. Add the pieces to the bowl with the chicken, beans, and enchilada sauce, and carefully fold them together until evenly combined and coated in sauce.
step 8:
Spread the dough mixture into the casserole dish and make sure it's in an even layer across the bottom. The mixture should not be piled too thick. Cover the dish with foil and bake for 20 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for 10-15 minutes more, or until the center is baked through. 
step 9:
Add the shredded cheese, and bake for another 5-7 minutes. Top with sliced green onions just before serving.

	amount: 4
	unit: oz. 
step 0:
Preheat the oven to 400ºF. In a small bowl combine the smoked paprika, garlic powder, cayenne, salt, and some freshly cracked pepper.
step 1:
Spread the frozen cauliflower florets out onto a baking sheet (no need to thaw first), then drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle the spices over top. Toss the cauliflower in the oil and spices until they are fairly evenly coated.
step 2:
Transfer the seasoned cauliflower to the preheated oven and roast for 30 minutes, stirring once half way through.
step 3:
About half way through the roasting time, begin the cheese sauce. Add the evaporated milk and butter to a small sauce pot. Heat over medium, while stirring, until the butter has melted and the evaporated milk is hot. This should only take a couple of minutes.
step 4:
Turn the heat under the evaporated milk to LOW and begin whisking in the shredded cheddar, one handful at a time, making sure the cheese is fully melted before adding the next handful. Once all the cheese is melted into the evaporated milk the sauce will thicken. If it's still very liquidy, keep the sauce over low heat and whisk constantly until it thickens. Often the cheese appears to be completely melted, but it has not yet totally emulsified. Remove the cheese sauce from the heat until ready to serve.*
step 5:
Once the cauliflower has finished roasting, divide it into bowls or place it in a serving platter, then pour the cheese sauce over top. Serve immediately.

	amount: 10
	unit: oz.
step 0:
Prepare the garlic chicken marinade first. In a gallon-sized zip top bag or shallow dish combine the olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, oregano, salt, and some freshly cracked pepper. Add the chicken thighs, close the top of the bag, and massage the ingredients to combine. Let the chicken marinate for 30 minutes.
step 1:
While the chicken is marinating, prepare the dill yogurt sauce. In a small bowl combine the Greek yogurt, dried dill, lemon juice, and salt. Set the sauce aside
step 2:
Slice the grape tomatoes in half, dice the cucumber, and thinly slice the red onion. Place the red onion in a bowl of ice water and let it soak for 5-10 minutes to take the sharp edge off the flavor. 
step 3:
After the chicken has marinated for 30 minutes, cook the chicken thighs in a skillet over medium heat for about 5-7 minutes on each side, or until well browned and cooked through. Cook the chicken in two batches to prevent over crowding the skillet, which will prevent browning. Transfer the cooked chicken to a cutting board to rest for 5 minutes before slicing.
step 4:
To build the wraps, smear each flat bread with a couple tablespoons of hummus, pile some sliced chicken on top, then top with a handful of tomatoes, cucumbers, and a few slices of onion. Add a few dollops of the dill yogurt sauce, wrap the bread around the filling, and enjoy!

	name: tomato paste
	amount: 1
	unit: Tbsp
	name: mozzarella, shredded (optional)
	amount: 4
	unit: oz. 
step 0:
Chop the sun dried tomatoes into smaller pieces. In a large bowl, combine the flour, yeast, salt, dried basil, and chopped tomatoes. Stir until they are evenly combined. Stir the shredded mozzarella into the flour mixture.
step 1:
Dissolve the tomato paste into the warm water. Pour the tomato and water mixture into the flour mixture, and stir until a sticky ball of dough forms. You may need to add slightly more or less water to achieve the correct consistency. The dough should be fairly wet and sticky, but not so wet that it's glossy or slimy. There should be no dry flour left on the bottom of the bowl.
step 2:
Cover the bowl with the dough loosely, and let it rise for one hour, or until it is double in size.
step 3:
Once risen, sprinkle the dough liberally with flour and scrape it off the sides of the bowl. Turn the dough out onto a well floured surface and fold it over on itself 5-6 times, or just until the dough looks smooth.
step 4:
Place the dough on a piece of parchment paper and allow it to rise for another half hour. While the dough is rising, place your Dutch oven in the oven and set it to preheat to 425ºF. 
step 5:
After 30 minutes, very carefully remove the Dutch oven from your oven, and remove its lid. Lift your risen dough by picking up the parchment paper and then place it in the hot Dutch oven, paper and all. Place the lid back on the Dutch oven and return it to the hot oven.
step 6:
Let the bread bake with the lid on the Dutch oven for 30 minutes, then carefully remove the lid and let it bake for another 15-20 minutes, without the lid, to allow the crust to brown.
step 7:
Once baked, carefully remove the hot Dutch oven from the oven, lift the bread out using the parchment, and allow it to cool before slicing and serving.

Once the sweet potatoes have finished roasting, give them a taste and add a pinch more salt, if needed. Roughly chop the cilantro and sprinkle it over top just before serving.

	unit: n/a
	name: pizza sauce (for dipping)
	amount: 1/2
	unit: cup
step 0:
Preheat the oven to 400ºF. Lightly spritz a baking sheet with spray oil or brush a thin layer of your favorite cooking oil onto the baking sheet.
step 1:
Stack about 4 tortillas at a time on a plate and cover with a damp paper towel. Microwave for 20-30 seconds, or until they are steamy and pliable. Microwave the second batch when you're ready to roll more.
step 2:
Slice each of the mozzarella sticks in half, lengthwise. Place about 5 pepperoni on each tortilla in the bottom 1/3 o the circle, then place the halved mozzarella stick on top. Fold the sides of the tortilla in to cover the ends, then roll them up tight light a burrito.
step 3:
Place the tightly rolled Pizza Roll Ups on the baking sheet, seam side down. Leave them slightly apart from one another to allow hot air to surround the rolls. Either spritz the top with spray oil, or brush a thin layer of oil on top of the roll ups.
step 4:
Bake the Pizza Roll Ups for 12-15 minutes, or until they're lightly browned and the cheese is just beginning to ooze. Because every oven is different, begin checking on the Pizza Roll Ups at about 10 minutes, then check ever two minutes or so until they're done.
step 5:
Serve immediately, with pizza sauce for dipping.

	name: soy sauce
	amount: 1
	unit: tsp
	name: carrots
	amount: 1
	unit: lb. 
step 0:
Preheat the oven to 400ºF. In a bowl, combine the miso, maple syrup, melted butter, grated ginger, and soy sauce. Stir them together until smooth.
step 1:
Peel and slice the carrots into about 1-inch sections (for thicker parts of the carrots, cut them slightly shorter, for thinner parts of the carrots, cut them slightly longer). Place the carrot pieces on a non-stuck baking sheet or a baking sheet lined with foil.
step 2:
Pour the maple miso butter over the carrots and stir the carrots until they are evenly coated. Spread the carrots out over the sheet so there is a little bit of space between each piece. This is critical to the caramelization of the maple miso butter.
step 3:
Roast the carrots in the oven for 15 minutes, then stir. Make sure to spread them back out after stirring, then return them to the oven for an additional 15 minutes. If the carrots are nicely golden brown at that point they are finished. If not, stir one more time and roast for an additional 5-10 minutes to achieve browning.

	unit: cups
	name: soy sauce
	amount: 1
	unit: Tbsp 
	name: toasted sesame oil
	amount: 1
	unit: tsp
step 0:
Use a vegetable peeler to peel the broccoli stem and carrot. Use a large-holed cheese grater to grate the broccoli stem and carrot. You should have about 1 cup of each after shredding.
step 1:
Slice the green onions, separating the white ends from the green ends. Roughly chop the kimchi, making sure all the pieces are about bite sized. Place the eggs in a bowl and lightly whisk with a fork.
step 2:
Heat a large skillet or wok over medium to medium-high heat. Once hot, add the oil and swirl to coat the surface. Add the white ends of the green onion and sauté for about one minute, or just until slightly softened.
step 3:
Add the shredded broccoli stem and carrots to the skillet and sauté for about one minute more. Finally, add the chopped kimchi and 2-4 Tbsp kimchi juice (depending on how strong you want your kimchi flavor) and let it simmer until the juice reduces and the skillet is fairly dry again.
step 4:
Add the day-old rice to the skillet and fold it together with the vegetables. Allow the rice to heat through. Push the rice off to the sides of the skillet and pour the eggs in the center. Gently scramble the eggs until they are set, then fold them into the rice.
step 5:
Finally, turn the heat off and sprinkle the soy sauce and toasted sesame oil over the fried rice. Gently fold the rice until the soy sauce and sesame oil are incorporated. Taste the kimchi fried rice and adjust the saltiness to your liking by adding more soy sauce if needed. If you want more tanginess or heat, you can add more kimchi juice. Finally, top with the sliced green ends of the green onions just before serving.

	unit: n/a
	name: boneless skinless chicken breasts*
	amount: 1.5
	unit: lbs.
step 0:
Add the olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, oregano, salt, and pepper to a large zip top bag, or a large shallow dish. Close the bag and massage to combine the ingredients, or stir the ingredients in the dish until combined.
step 1:
Filet each chicken breast into two thinner pieces. Place the pieces in the bag or dish, making sure the chicken pieces are completely covered in marinade. Marinate the chicken for 30 minutes up to 8 hours, turning occasionally to maximize the chicken's contact with the marinade.
step 2:
When ready to cook, heat a large skillet over medium flame. Transfer the chicken from the marinade to the hot skillet and cook on each side until well browned and cooked through (about 5-7 minutes each side, depending on the size of the pieces). I cooked two pieces at a time to avoid over crowding the skillet, which can cause juices to pool and prevents browning. Discard the excess marinade.
step 3:
Transfer the cooked chicken from the skillet to a cutting board and let rest for five minutes before slicing and serving.

step 1:
Finely dice the roasted red peppers and finely chop the green onion. Add both to the bowl with the other ingredients. Use a hand mixer to combine the mixture until the cream cheese is well incorporated (the mixture will still be lumpy because of the shredded cheese and diced peppers).
step 2:
Taste the mixture and add more sriracha to your liking. I added a total of 3 Tbsp sriracha. Keep in mind that the spiciness will increase slightly as the mixture refrigerates.
step 3:
Serve immediately, or refrigerate until ready to eat. The mixture will keep in the refrigerator for 4-5 days.

	unit: lb.
	name: green onions, sliced
	amount: 2
	unit: n/a
	name: sesame seeds
	amount: 1
	unit: Tbsp
step 0:
Begin by pressing the tofu for about 30 minutes to remove the excess moisture. Place the block of tofu between two flat plates, rimmed baking sheets, or cutting boards and place something heavy on top, like a cast iron skillet or a pot full of water. If using cutting boards or something without a rim to hold in the water that seeps out, place paper towels or a clean dishcloth under the tofu to catch the liquid as it is expelled.
step 1:
While the tofu is pressing, begin the rice. Cook your rice according to the package directions, making sure to include salt. Once the rice has cooked, fluff it with a fork and then drizzle 1/2 Tbsp toasted sesame oil over top. Fold the oil into the rice, making sure not to stir too vigorously, then repeat with the second 1/2 Tbsp of sesame oil. The rice should now have a wonderful toasty nutty flavor and aroma. Set the rice aside.
step 2:
Once the tofu has pressed, pour off the excess liquid. Slice the block of tofu into 16 triangles (I cut the thickness of the block in half, then cut the stacked halves into quarters, and each piece into two triangles). Place the tofu pieces in a shallow bowl or dish.
step 3:
In a small bowl, stir together the ingredients for the tofu marinade: oil, soy sauce, minced garlic, and brown sugar. Pour the marinade over the tofu pieces and turn them all to make sure all sides are coated. Allow the tofu to marinate for about 20 minutes, turning the pieces once or twice during that time. After 20 minutes, most of the marinade should be absorbed.
step 4:
While the tofu is marinating and the rice is cooking prepare the spicy peanut sauce. In a bowl stir together the peanut butter, sriracha, soy sauce, grated ginger, brown sugar, and enough hot water to create a smooth sauce (3-4 Tbsp). Set the sauce aside.
step 5:
Once the tofu has marinated, heat a large non-stick skillet over medium flame. Add just a splash of oil to the skillet (about 1 tsp) and swirl to coat the skillet. Add the tofu pieces and any remaining marinade, and cook on each side until deeply browned. 
step 6:
Once the tofu pieces are browned, remove them from the skillet and add the snap peas. Quickly sauté the snap peas in the skillet until they turn bright green and are still crisp. You just want to remove the raw edge. Remove them from the skillet to prevent over cooking.
step 7:
To build the bowls, add about 1.5 cups sesame rice to each bowl and then top with 1/4 of the tofu pieces and snap peas. Drizzle spicy peanut sauce over each bowl and then sprinkle sliced green onions and sesame seeds over each.

	amount: 3
	unit: oz.
step 0:
Preheat the oven to 350ºF. Finely dice the onion and mince the garlic. Add the butter, onions, and garlic to a large pot and sauté over medium heat until the onions are soft and transparent.
step 1:
While the onions and garlic are sautéing, Slice the carrots and dice the celery. Add the carrots and celery to the pot and continue to sauté.
step 2:
While the carrots and celery are sautéing, wash and chop the mushrooms. Add the mushrooms to the pot along with the salt, pepper, thyme, and sage. Continue to sauté until the mushrooms have turned brown and completely wilted.
step 3:
Add the flour to the pot and continue to stir and cook for about 2-3 minutes more, or until the flour coats the bottom of the pot and begins to turn a light golden color. Whisk in the vegetable broth, making sure all the flour dissolves from the bottom of the pot. The mixture should thicken fairly quickly.
step 4:
Once thickened, whisk in the milk and allow it to come up to a simmer again. Once simmering, turn the heat off, taste, and add more salt or pepper if needed. You want the sauce to be slightly on the salty side so that the flavor doesn't dilute too much once the rice is added.
step 5:
Stir the cooked rice into the pot with the sauce and vegetables. Transfer everything to a 2 to 3 quart casserole dish and top with the fried onions. Bake the casserole in the preheated 350ºF oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the sauce is bubbling up around the edges and the fried onions have turned deep golden brown. Serve hot.

step 0:
Dice the chorizo, then add it to the instant pot along with the cooking oil. Press the Sauté button, then the Adjust button to select the "less" temperature setting. Sauté the chorizo in the oil, without a lid, until it becomes slightly crispy on the edges.
step 1:
While the chorizo is sautéing, dice the onion and mince the garlic. Once the chorizo is crispy, add the onion and garlic and continue to sauté until the onions are soft and transparent.
step 2:
Add the beans, bay leaves, and pepper to the pot and wait a moment to let the beans absorb some of the heat and prevent the broth from splattering when it hits the hot pot. 
step 3:
Add the broth to the pot, stir briefly to combine, then place the lid on the Instant Pot. Close the steam valve, press the Manual button, select high pressure (if not selected automatically), then press the + button to increase the time to 35 minutes.
step 4:
Allow the beans to cook through the 35 minute cycle, then let the pressure release naturally (you'll know the pressure has released when the silver float valve has fallen back down and is no longer flush with the top of the lid). 
step 5:
Once the pressure has released, open the steam valve, and then remove the lid. Discard the bay leaf. Add the canned diced tomatoes with all their juices, then stir to combine.
step 6:
Press the cancel button to cancel the "keep warm" function, then press the Sauté button and use the Adjust button to select the "normal" heat level. Let the mixture simmer, stirring often, until the beans are very tender and the liquid has thickened.
step 7:
Serve the beans with tortillas, tortilla chips, or over a bowl of rice, and with optional toppings like cheese, cilantro, green onions, or finely diced red onion.

	unit: tsp
step 0:
Place the sliced bread on a baking sheet. Slice the clove of garlic in half and rub the open face of the garlic over the surface of the sliced bread (leave the garlic peel on to make it easier to handle). Pour the olive oil in a small bowl, then brush it over the surface of the garlic rubbed bread. Set the bread aside and reserve the clove of garlic and leftover oil for the tomatoes.
step 1:
Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, pour the remaining olive oil from the bowl into the skillet and swirl it to coat the surface. Add the grape tomatoes and allow them to cook, stirring only occasionally, until they blister, pop, and begin to lose their shape. The juices will brown and caramelize on the skillet.
step 2:
While the tomatoes are cooking, mince the garlic clove. Once the tomatoes have split open and lost their shape, add the minced garlic and continue to sauté for 1-2 minutes, or until the garlic is a little softened and has lost its raw edge.
step 3:
Turn the heat down to medium-low, add the balsamic vinegar and rosemary*, and stir and cook until the vinegar has dissolved any brown bits from the bottom of the skillet and it has thickened just slightly. Turn the heat down even further (to low), add the butter and a pinch of salt, and stir until the butter has melted into the sauce.
step 4:
Rinse and drain the Cannellini beans, then add them to the skillet. Stir them into the tomatoes and sauce, and allow them to heat through.
step 5:
While the beans are heating, turn the oven on to broil and place the baking sheet with the bread into the oven. Watch the bread closely as it broils and remove it from the oven when the top is golden brown (depending on how close the oven's rack is to the broiler, this may be only a few minutes).
step 6:
To serve, top each slice of bread with a hefty scoop of the tomatoes and beans, then add a pinch of Parmesan.

	name: Instant or rapid rise yeast
	amount: 2
	unit: tsp
	name: brown sugar
	amount: 1
	unit: tsp
	name: warm water
	amount: 1
	unit: cup

	unit: cup
	name: all-purpose flour
	amount: 1.5-2
	unit: cups
	name: egg (optional)
	amount: 1
	unit: large
step 0:
Combine the yeast, brown sugar, and warm water in a bowl and stir to dissolve the yeast and sugar. Let the yeast mixture sit for about 5 minutes, or until the mixture becomes frothy on top.
step 1:
While waiting for the yeast to bloom, Add the whole wheat flour, salt, melted butter, cocoa powder, and molasses to a large bowl (no need to stir them together just yet).
step 2:
Once the yeast mixture is frothy, pour it into the bowl with the flour and other ingredients, and stir until a smooth mixture forms.
step 3:
Begin stirring in all-purpose flour, 1/2 cup at a time, until a ball of dough forms and you can no longer stir it with a spoon. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for five minutes, slowly adding more flour as you knead to prevent the dough from sticking.
step 4:
After kneading for five minutes, you should have a soft, buoyant ball of dough that no longer sticks to your hands. You should have used between 1.5 and 2 cups of all-purpose flour total. Place the dough back in the mixing bowl, cover loosely with plastic, and allow it to rise for one hour, or until it is double in volume (rise time will depend on the ambient temperature).
step 5:
When the dough has risen, sprinkle a little flour on top to keep your hand from sticking, then punch it down to deflate. Scrape the dough out of the bowl and transfer it to a lightly floured surface. Cut the dough into four equal sized pieces, then cut each of the quarters into three smaller pieces. 
step 6:
Shape each piece of dough into a ball, then place it in a baking dish coated in non-stick spray, oil, or butter. Allow the shaped rolls to rise for another 45 minutes to an hour, or until double in size again.
step 7:
Preheat the oven to 375ºF. Add the egg to a small bowl along with a splash of water. Whisk the egg until smooth, then carefully brush it over the surface of the rolls (this creates a dark glossy finish to the rolls and is optional). 
step 8:
Bake the rolls in the preheated oven for 25 minutes, or until they are deep brown and sound hollow when tapped. Allow the rolls to cool slightly, then serve.

	unit: oz.
	name: green onions
	amount: 2
	unit: n/a
	name: salt & pepper
	amount: n/a
	unit: Pinch
step 0:
Preheat the oven to 400ºF. Stack the tortillas and then cut them into six equal sized wedges. Place the tortilla wedges in a bowl and drizzle the cooking oil over top. Gently toss the tortillas until they are well coated in oil.
step 1:
Spread the oil coated tortilla triangles out over a baking sheet in a single layer. Bake the tortillas for 8-10 minutes, stirring once half way through, or until they are golden brown and crispy. Leave the oven turned on.
step 2:
While the tortillas are baking, prepare the other ingredients. Lightly whisk the eggs, drain the can of green chiles, measure the sour cream, and slice the green onions. Also gather 2 Tbsp butter and 2 oz. queso fresco or shredded Monterey jack cheese.
step 3:
Add the butter to a large skillet and heat over medium, or just below medium. Allow the butter to melt, then swirl the skillet to coat the bottom and around the edges. Pour the eggs into the hot skillet and gently scramble the eggs until they are about 60% solid (if you want to skip the oven and cook it all on the stove top, cook the eggs until they are about 85-90% solid). Season the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper.
step 4:
Take the eggs off the heat and spoon the green chiles over the surface. Add the sour cream in dollops all over the eggs. Add the baked tortilla chips and then gently fold them into the eggs so they are half covered beneath the eggs. Finally, crumble the queso fresco or sprinkle shredded Monterey jack over top.
step 5:
Transfer the skillet to the oven (still set to 400ºF) and bake for 5-8 minutes, or until the eggs are set and the cheese is melted. If cooking entirely on the stove top, place a lid on the skillet and place it over medium heat until the egg are fully set and the cheese is melted.
step 6:
Sprinkle sliced green onions over top just before serving.

	unit: tsp 
	name: sugar
	amount: 1
	unit: Tbsp
	name: cinnamon
	amount: 1/2
	unit: tsp
step 0:
Preheat the oven to 400ºF. Cut each round pita in half to make them easier to work with, then separate the two layers of the pita bread (use a knife to create clean edges instead of torn edges). Cut each piece of pita into 1-inch triangles and place them in a large bowl.
step 1:
Melt the butter in the microwave, then stir in the vanilla extract. Drizzle the vanilla butter over the pita triangles in the bowl and toss until the pita is completely coated in butter. 
step 2:
Spread the butter coated pita pieces out over a baking sheet in a single layer. Bake the pitas in the oven for 8-10 minutes, or until they are golden brown and crispy. Stir the pita pieces every 3-4 minutes as they bake to make sure they cook evenly and to keep an eye on the browning. Every oven varies a bit as do pita pieces, so base your baking time on the color and texture of the pita pieces, rather than a strict 8-10 minutes. They should be golden and crispy when finished.
step 3:
After baking, transfer the pita crisps back to the buttered bowl. In a separate small dish stir together the sugar and cinnamon. Sprinkle the sugar and cinnamon mixture over the baked pita crisps, then toss until they are well coated in cinnamon and sugar. Serve immediately, or allow the crisps to cool and store in an air-tight container.

Once incorporated, repeat with the second 1/3 of the mixture, and then again once more with the final third of the pumpkin mixture. Make sure to fold gently and do not vigorously stir to prevent the whipped cream from losing its volume.
step 4:
Once the mixtures are fully incorporated and smooth, the mousse is ready to serve. Or, chill until ready to eat.

	unit: n/a
step 0:
Remove the casing from the sausage and add the sausage to a large deep skillet, or wide bottomed soup pot, along with the olive oil. Sauté the sausage over medium heat, breaking it into pieces as you go, until the sausage is cooked through, brown, and crispy on the edges (about 10 minutes).
step 1:
While the sausage is cooking, rinse and drain the cannellini beans. Once the sausage is brown and crispy, add the beans and some freshly cracked pepper to the skillet. Gently stir the beans into the sausage to coat them in the fat, and allow them to heat through.
step 2:
As the beans are heating through, roughly chop the spinach. Add the spinach to the skillet or pot in batches, gently stirring it into the sausage and beans until it wilts down. Once the spinach is mostly wilted, turn the heat off. Taste the mixture and add salt if needed (this will depend on the salt content of your sausage and beans). Serve hot.

Combine the soy sauce, brown sugar, and 1/2 cup water in a bowl and stir until the brown sugar is dissolved. Mince the garlic and grate the ginger. Add the garlic, ginger, and toasted sesame oil to the soy sauce mixture. Set the cooking liquid aside.
step 1:
Either slice or cube the beef roast. Slice three of the green onions into 1.5-2 inch sections (save the rest of the green onions for garnish after cooking). Place the beef roast and green onions in the slow cooker. Pour the cooking liquid over top and stir to combine.
step 2:
Place a lid on the slow cooker, and cook on HIGH for four hours or LOW for eight hours. After four hours on high or eight hours on low the beef should be very tender and should shred easily with a fork. If not, replace the lid and cook for 30-60 minutes more.
step 3:
Once the beef is tender, it's time to thicken the sauce. Dissolve the cornstarch in 2 tablespoons of water, then pour it into the pot with the beef and cooking liquid. Stir to combine, then allow it to come back up to a simmer, at which point the sauce will thicken just slightly. Turn the heat off and garnish with the sesame seeds and remaining green onions (sliced). Serve over a bed of rice or as part of your favorite meal.

	name: vanilla extract
	amount: 1/2
	unit: tsp
	name: strong coffee
	amount: 5-6
	unit: cups
step 0:
To make the salted caramel, add the granulated sugar and water to a heavy bottomed sauce pot. Place the pot over medium-high heat and stir until the sugar is dissolved and it begins to boil. Turn the heat down to medium-low and allow the sugar to boil, without stirring, until it turns a deep amber color (about 7-10 minutes).
step 1:
Once the sugar turns deep amber, remove it from the heat immediately, as it can go from caramelized to burned rather quickly. Whisk in the heavy cream until smooth (if the caramelized sugar clumps from the cold cream, simply return the pot to very low heat and whisk until it has dissolved in). Whisk in the butter, salt, and vanilla extract.
step 2:
Allow the caramel to cool (it will thicken considerably as it cools). This batch of caramel makes about 10 ounces and can stay refrigerated for up to 3 weeks.
step 3:
To make the Salted Caramel Iced coffee, place about 2 Tbsp of the salted caramel in the bottom of a mug or heat safe cup. Add 8 ounces strong coffee and stir until the caramel has dissolved.
step 4:
Fill a separate serving glass with ice (if desired, drizzle more caramel inside the glass first). Pour the coffee and caramel mixture over the ice. Serve immediately, or add a splash of milk or cream, and a small pinch of sea salt.

	amount: 3
	unit: n/a
	name: cooked rice
	amount: 6
	unit: cups
step 0:
Slice the smoked sausage into medallions. Add the olive oil and sliced sausage to the multi-function pressure cooker or a skillet and sauté the sausage until it is brown on both sides (about 5 minutes). Once the sausage is well browned, remove it from the pot with a slotted spoon.
step 1:
While the sausage is browning, finely dice the onion, bell pepper, and celery, and mince the garlic. After removing the sausage, add the onion, bell pepper, celery, and garlic to the pot and continue to sauté for another five minutes, or until the onions are soft and transparent. The moisture from the vegetables should dissolve the browned bits off the bottom of the pot.
step 2:
Rinse and sort through the beans to remove any bad beans or debris. Add the beans to the pot along with the cooked sausage, thyme, oregano, paprika, cayenne, some freshly cracked pepper (about 20 cranks of a pepper mill), chicken broth, and water. Stir to combine.
step 3:
Secure the lid on the pressure cooker and close the vent. Cook on high pressure for 35 minutes (either use the manual button or bean/chili button on the Instant Pot and increase time to 35 minutes), then let the pot naturally release pressure as it cools. Test the beans to make sure they're extremely soft. If they're not soft yet, re-secure the lid, close the vent, and cook for an additional 20 minutes on high power.
step 4:
Once the beans are very soft, stir and smash the beans agains the side of the pot with the back of a large spoon until the liquid thickens. Taste and add salt as needed (start with a teaspoon and add more until the flavors pop).
step 5:
Add about 1.5 cups of red beans to a bowl, top with 1 cup rice and a sprinkle of sliced green onions.

step 0:
Prepare the sauce first, so it's ready to go when needed. In a small bowl stir together the soy sauce, toasted sesame oil, chili garlic sauce, brown sugar, water, and cornstarch until the cornstarch is dissolved. Set the sauce aside.
step 1:
Cook the noodles according to the package directions, then drain in a colander. The wide rice noodles I used needed to be boiled for about 7-8 minutes.
step 2:
While the noodles are cooking, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add the cooking oil, sliced mushrooms, and minced garlic. Sauté until the mushrooms release all their moisture and begin to brown on the edges.
step 3:
Add the frozen broccoli florets (no need to thaw) and sauté for just a couple minutes more, or until they are no longer frozen but still bright green (they may still be cold, but they will heat through in the next steps. It's important not to over cook the broccoli).
step 4:
Finally, add the cooked and drained noodles and the prepared sauce. Stir and cook, still over medium heat, for 1-2 minutes more or until everything is cooked through and the sauce has thickened and no longer pools on the bottom of the skillet. Top with sliced green onions and serve.

	name: sour cream (optional)
	amount: 4
	unit: Tbsp
	name: salsa 
	amount: 4
	unit: Tbsp
step 0:
Wash the potatoes well, then place them in a large sauce pot and cover with water. Place a lid on the pot and bring it up to a boil over high heat. Boil the potatoes just until they are tender enough to pierce with a fork, but not so soft that they'll fall apart when pierced (about 7-10 minutes, depending on the size of the potatoes). Drain the potatoes and let them cool slightly.
step 1:
While the potatoes are boiling, begin cooking the chorizo. Heat a large skillet over medium, then add a tablespoon of cooking oil. Swirl the oil to coat the surface, then add the chorizo (if it's in links, squeeze it out of the casing into the skillet). Cook the chorizo, breaking it up into smaller pieces as it cooks, until it's brown, crispy, and cooked through (about 5-7 minutes). Use a slotted spoon to remove the cooked chorizo to a clean bowl.
step 2:
While the chorizo is cooking, finely dice the bell pepper and onion. After removing the chorizo from the skillet, add the diced bell pepper and onion to the remaining fat and oil in the skillet, along with a pinch of salt and pepper. Sauté the onion and bell pepper until they are soft and browned on the edges (5-7 minutes). The moisture from the vegetables should help loosen the browned bits from the bottom of the skillet, which will in turn flavor the vegetables. Use the slotted spoon to remove the cooked bell pepper and onion to the bowl with the chorizo.
step 3:
While the bell pepper and onion are cooking, dice the boiled potatoes into 1/4-inch cubes. After removing the bell pepper and onion from the skillet, add an additional tablespoon of oil and swirl to coat the surface of the skillet. Add the diced potatoes along with another pinch of salt and pepper, and a 1/2 tsp of chili powder. Cook the potatoes in the hot oil, stirring only occasionally, until the potatoes are brown and crispy (about 10 minutes). Avoid stirring too often as this will prevent the potatoes from forming a brown crispy exterior.
step 4:
Finally, add the chorizo, bell pepper, and onion back to the skillet and stir to combine. Top with sliced green onion. Divide the hash between four plates, add a fried egg, and top with a dollop of sour cream and salsa.

	unit: n/a
	name: shredded sharp cheddar 
	amount: 1.5
	unit: cups
step 0:
Fill the skillet two-thirds full of water, add the salt, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.
step 1:
Add the macaroni, turn the heat to medium, and cook, stirring occasionally, until just shy of al dente. This should take about 10 minutes, but check the pasta package for recommended cooking times and aim for the lower end if a range is given. (The macaroni will continue to cook a bit in the sauce.) When the macaroni is ready, biting into a piece should reveal a very thin core of uncooked pasta.
step 2:
Drain the macaroni and return it to the skillet. Turn the heat to low. Add the butter and stir until it melts.
step 3:
Add the evaporated milk, mustard, and cayenne and stir well to combine. Add the cheese in three batches, stirring frequently as each batch is added and waiting until the cheese has melted before adding the next batch. After about 5 minutes total, the sauce will be smooth and noticeably thicker.
step 4:
Serve hot. Leftovers can be refrigerated in a covered container for up to 2 days.

step 0:
Preheat the oven to 400ºF. Add the butter and garlic to a skillet and sauté over medium heat for about one minute. Whisk the flour into the melted butter and continue to cook and stir for about two minutes. The butter and flour should form a paste that will foam and bubble as it cooks.
step 1:
Whisk the milk into the butter and flour mixture until there are no lumps. Stir in the salt, nutmeg, and some freshly cracked pepper (about 10 cranks of a pepper mill).
step 2:
Allow the milk to come to a simmer, whisking often, at which point it will thicken to a gravy-like consistency. Whisk in the grated Parmesan until it has melted. Add the frozen chopped spinach (no need to thaw) and continue to stir and cook until it has heated through (about 5 minutes). Taste the creamed spinach and add more salt if needed.
step 3:
Use a large spoon to create four wells in the creamed spinach. Crack one egg into each well. It's okay if the whites run outside of the wells. Sprinkle the crumbled feta over the entire skillet.
step 4:
Bake the spinach and eggs for about 15 minutes in the preheated 400ºF oven, or until the whites are mostly set. Spoon the creamed spinach and an egg into a bowl and serve as is or with toast for dipping.

	name: butter
	amount: 1
	unit: Tbsp
	name: salt and pepper
	amount: pinch
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Preheat the oven to 400ºF. Wash the sweet potatoes, pat them dry, and prick their skins a few times with a fork. Slice the sweet potatoes in half lengthwise, then place them on a baking sheet. Drizzle the cooking oil over the potatoes, then use your hands to smear the oil over their entire surface (skin and cut sides), leaving a liberal amount of oil on the baking sheet under the potatoes to keep them from sticking.
step 1:
Place the sweet potatoes with the cut side up, then sprinkle with cinnamon, a pinch of cayenne pepper, and a pinch of salt. Flip the sweet potatoes over so they are cut side down, then roast for 45-50 minutes, or until they are soft all the way through and the juices are caramelized and bubbling out of the holes in the skin.
step 2:
While the sweet potatoes are roasting, prepare the chicken and green beans. Combine the spices for the chicken in a small bowl (smoked paprika, brown sugar, garlic powder, cayenne, salt, and freshly ground pepper-about 20 cranks of a pepper mill). 
step 3:
Pat the chicken dry, then sprinkle the spice rub over both sides. Heat a large skillet over medium, then add the cooking oil and swirl to coat the surface. Add the chicken and cook until they are deeply browned on each side and the internal temp has reached 165ºF. Remove the chicken to a cutting board and let it rest.
step 4:
While the chicken is cooking, prepare the green beans. Add about one inch water to a sauce pot and place a steaming basket in the pot. Add the green beans to the basket, place a lid on top, and place them over medium-high heat. Allow the water to come up to a boil and steam the green beans for 7-10 minutes, or until they are bright green and only slightly softened. 
step 5:
Remove the green beans from the pot, pour out the water, and place the beans back in the pot without the steaming basket. Add 1 Tbsp butter and allow the residual heat from the beans to melt the butter. Stir to coat, then season with a pinch of salt and pepper.
step 6:
Slice the chicken breasts into strips. Divide the sweet potato halves, green beans, and chicken between four containers or plates. Serve immediately or refrigerate and reheat later.

	name: Italian parsley (flat leaf)
	amount: 1/4
	unit: bunch
step 0:
Wash the zucchini, yellow squash, and red bell pepper. Remove the stems, then cut them into large slices or pieces (remove the seeds from the bell pepper. Slice the red onion into thick slices.
step 1:
Place the zucchini, yellow squash, red bell pepper, red onion, and grape tomatoes on a large baking sheet and drizzle olive oil over top. Gently toss the vegetables until they are well coated in oil. Sprinkle a pinch of salt and pepper over top. (Grape tomatoes are generally too small to place directly on a grill, so if using a grill just add the tomatoes to the salad fresh.)
step 2:
Grill the vegetables over an open flame until they are charred and tender. OR, adjust your oven's top rack to be about 6 inches below the broiler unit and turn the broiler on to high. Place the baking sheet under the broiler and watch it closely until the vegetable become charred and tender (about 10-15 minutes, depending on your oven and distance from the broiler).
step 3:
Allow the vegetables to cool slightly after grilling or broiling. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil to cook the pasta. Once boiling, add the pasta and boil for 7-10 minutes, or just until the pasta is tender. Drain the pasta in a colander and allow it to cool slightly (until it's no longer steaming).
step 4:
While the pasta is cooking and the vegetables are cooling, prepare the creamy balsamic vinaigrette. To a jar or bowl add the olive oil, balsamic vinegar, mayonnaise, Dijon, garlic, basil, salt, and pepper. Whisk the ingredients together or close the jar and shake until combined.**
step 5:
Once the vegetables are cool enough to handle, chop them into smaller, 1-inch pieces. Roughly chop the parsley leaves.
step 6:
In a large bowl, combine the pasta, chopped vegetables, and parsley. Pour the vinaigrette over top, starting with half and adding more to your liking. Gently stir the pasta and vegetables until everything is coated in dressing. Serve immediately or refrigerate until ready to eat.

	amount: 2
	unit: Tbsp
step 0:
Peel and cube the potatoes into 1-inch pieces. Rinse them well in a colander, then transfer to a pot and add 1/2 tsp salt and enough water to cover. Place a lid on the pot and heat over high until the water begins to boil. Boil the potatoes until very tender (about 7-10 minutes). Drain the potatoes in the colander and rinse briefly with hot water again to remove excess starch.
step 1:
While the potatoes are draining, return the pot to the stove and add the butter and milk. Heat over low until the butter has melted and the milk is hot. Return the cooked potatoes to the pot, turn the heat off, and mash until smooth. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
step 2:
Meanwhile, make the Creamy Dijon Dressing. Combine all the ingredients (olive oil, Dijon, mayonnaise, red wine vinegar, salt, pepper, sugar, garlic powder) in a small bowl or jar and whisk until combined. Set the dressing aside.
step 3:
Preheat the oven to 425ºF. Remove any wilted or damaged leaves from the Brussels sprouts and slice them in half. Slice the sausage into 1/2-inch wide medallions. 
step 4:
Add both the Brussels sprouts and sausage to a large baking dish and drizzle 2 Tbsp olive oil over top. Toss the Brussels sprouts and sausage in the oil until everything is well coated and the baking sheet has a good layer of oil on its surface as well. Roast the Brussels sprouts and sausage in the hot oven for 20-25 minutes, or until they are well browned, stirring once half way through. Season with a pinch of salt after cooking.
step 5:
To build the bowls, add about 1 cup of mashed potatoes to each bowl, then add 1/4 of the roasted Brussels sprouts and sausage to each bowl. Drizzle a couple spoonfuls of the creamy Dijon dressing over top just before serving.

step 0:
Begin heating a 10" or larger cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Allow it to preheat, before adding the oil, for at least five minutes.
step 1:
Remove any damaged leaves from the cabbage and rinse it well. Cut it in half, then cut one of the halves into four wedges. Leave the core intact (cut off the very end if it is dirty or damaged). Reserve the second half for a different recipe.
step 2:
Once the cast iron skillet is fully heated, add 1-2 Tbsp of oil and swirl to coat the surface of the skillet. Add the cabbage wedges to the skillet, making sure that each piece is laying flat on the surface of the skillet. Season the pieces with a pinch of salt and pepper. Let the cabbage cook undisturbed for about 7 minutes, or until the bottom side is well blackened.
step 3:
Flip the cabbage and season the second side with a pinch of salt and pepper. Let cook undisturbed on the second side for about 7 minutes, or until well blackened. The skillet may be smoking, so be sure to turn on your vent hood.
step 4:
Once the cabbage pieces have a good amount of black on each side, turn off the heat, place a lid on the skillet, and let it steam until the cabbage (including the core) is tender (5-7 minutes).
step 5:
While the cabbage is cooking, prepare the chipotle mayo by combining the mayonnaise, chipotle powder, garlic powder, salt, lemon juice, and olive oil in a bowl. Set the chipotle mayo aside until ready to use. Once the cabbage is tender, place a wedge on each plate and drizzle the chipotle mayo over top.

ingredients:
	name: sweet Italian sausage
	amount: 8
	unit: oz
	name: olive oil 
	amount: 1
	unit: Tbsp
	name: garlic, minced
	amount: 2
	unit: cloves
	name: frozen broccoli florets 
	amount: 1/2
	unit: lb
	name: chicken broth* 
	amount: 2
	unit: cups
	name: sun dried tomatoes 
	amount: 1/3
	unit: cup
	name: pasta (any small shape**)
	amount: 8

	name: Pinch of red pepper (optional)
	amount: n/a
	unit: n/a
	name: grated Parmesan 
	amount: 1/4
	unit: cup
step 0:
Add the olive oil and sausage to the skillet and cook over medium heat until browned. If using links, cook them until browned on the outside and firm enough to slice, then slice into medallions, return to the skillet, and brown on both sides. Transfer the cooked sausage to a clean bowl and drain off all but about 1 Tbsp fat from the skillet.
step 1:
Add the minced garlic and frozen broccoli florets to the skillet. Sauté over medium heat for 3-5 minutes, or just until the broccoli is bright green and no longer frozen. Transfer the broccoli florets to the bowl with the sausage.
step 2:
Add the chicken broth to the skillet and stir or whisk to dissolve the browned bits off the bottom of the skillet. Slice the sun dried tomatoes into strips and add them to the broth with the pasta and a pinch of red pepper flakes. Stir, place a lid on top, and turn the heat up to medium high. When the broth begins to boil, give the skillet a quick stir, replace the lid, and turn the heat down to low or just above low so that the broth maintains a simmer.
step 3:
Simmer the pasta and sun dried tomatoes for about 7 minutes, stirring every couple of minutes, or until the pasta is tender and most of the liquid is absorbed. If the pasta becomes tender before all the broth has been absorbed, simply let it simmer for the last couple of minutes without the lid.
step 4:
Once the pasta is tender and only a small amount of thickened liquid remains in the bottom of the skillet, add the cooked sausage and broccoli back to the pasta. Stir to combine and sprinkle the grated Parmesan over top. Serve immediately.

step 0:
Preheat the oven to 400ºF. Line a baking sheet with parchment. Use a small-holed cheese grater or a zester to remove the zest from the lemon, then squeeze the juice into a separate bowl. You'll need about 1 tsp of zest and 1 Tbsp juice.
step 1:
In a large bowl, stir together the flour, salt, 1/4 cup powdered sugar, baking powder, poppy seeds, and 1 tsp lemon zest. Make sure these ingredients are well combined.
step 2:
Stir the cream into the dry ingredients until a shaggy ball of dough forms. The dough will be fairly sticky. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface, divide it into three pieces, and shape each piece into a disc (about 3 inches diameter). Cut each disc into six triangles.
step 3:
Arrange the cut scones on the prepared baking sheet. Bake the scones for about 15 minutes, or until they just begin to barely turn golden brown on top.
step 4:
While the scones are baking, place the remaining 1/2 cup powdered sugar in a bowl. Stir in about 1 Tbsp lemon juice, or just enough to form a thick glaze.
step 5:
When the scones have baked, remove them from the oven, let them cool, then drizzle with the prepared lemon glaze.

step 0:
Preheat the oven to 275ºF. Squeeze about 3 Tbsp lemon juice from the lemon(s) and slice the remainder. Mince two cloves of the garlic, and peel the remaining 4. In a small bowl, whisk together the lemon juice, olive oil, minced garlic, salt, and pepper.
step 1:
Pat the chicken breasts dry with a paper towel. Place them in a glass or ceramic casserole dish. Pour the prepared lemon marinade over the chicken, using a spoon to redistribute the marinade and make sure the surface of the chicken is fully covered. Add the remaining cloves of peeled garlic and sliced lemon around the chicken. If you're sensitive to bitter flavors, add the additional lemon slices after baking. Cover the dish tightly with foil.
step 2:
Roast the chicken in the preheated oven for 90 minutes. After 90 minutes, turn the oven up to 425ºF, remove the foil, and baste the chicken with the juices from the bottom of the dish. Return the chicken to the oven and roast for an additional 20 minutes without foil at 425ºF, or until the skin is golden brown and crispy.
step 3:
Let the chicken rest for 5-10 minutes before slicing. Serve warm with the pan drippings spooned over top.

step 0:
Dice the onion and peel the garlic cloves. Place the onion, garlic, and cinnamon sticks in the bottom of the slow cooker.
step 1:
In a small bowl, combine the oregano, cumin, salt, pepper, and chipotle powder. Cut the pork roast into 2-inch cubes. Place the cubed meat in a bowl and sprinkle the spice mix over top. Toss the meat in the spices until evenly coated. Place the seasoned meat in the slow cooker on top of the onion, garlic, and cinnamon.
step 2:
Use a vegetable peeler to remove the thin layer of orange zest from one of the oranges. Squeeze about 1/2 cup juice from the oranges. Pour the orange juice over the meat in the slow cooker, than sprinkle the pieces of orange zest over top.
step 3:
Place a lid on the slow cooker, turn it on to high, and cook for 5 hours, or until the meat is tender and falls apart.
step 4:
Use tongs to stir and shred the meat, and remove the cinnamon sticks. Either divide the meat and liquid into smaller containers to refrigerate for later, or transfer the meat and some of the liquid to a skillet (preferably non-stick or cast iron). Cook the meat over medium flame until browned and crispy on the edges. Avoid stirring the meat too much as it will break down into tiny pieces. Use the crispy meat as a filling for tacos, burritos, nachos, or burrito bowls.

	name: bunch cilantro $0.23
	amount: 1/4
	unit: n/a
step 0:
If you haven't yet, take the corn out of the freezer and allow it to begin thawing. Preheat the oven to 400ºF.
step 1:
Peel the sweet potatoes, then cut them into a small dice (1/4-1/2 inch cubes). Place the cubes on a baking sheet, drizzle with cooking oil, cumin, and a pinch or two of salt. Toss the sweet potato cubes until they are all coated in oil and spices. Roast the sweet potatoes for about 30 minutes, or until they are soft and slightly browned on the edges. Remove from the oven and let cool slightly.
step 2:
While the sweet potatoes are roasting, prepare the lime crema. Use a small-holed cheese grater or a zester to remove the thin layer of green zest from the lime. Add about 1 tsp of the zest and 1 Tbsp of the lime juice to the sour cream, along with the minced clove of garlic and 1/4 tsp of salt. Stir to combine. Taste and adjust the lime juice as desired. Refrigerate the crema until ready to use.
step 3:
Heat a large skillet over medium to medium-high heat. Once hot, add 2 Tbsp cooking oil and swirl to coat the surface of the skillet. Add the thawed corn and let cook until the corn is blistered and charred on the edges. Avoid stirring too often to allow it to blacken a bit. Let the corn cool slightly.
step 4:
Finely dice the red bell pepper and red onion. Rinse and drain the black beans. Pull the cilantro leaves from their stems and then roughly chop.
step 5:
Combine the roasted sweet potatoes, blackened corn, black beans, red bell pepper, red onion, and cilantro in a large dish. Stir to combine. Add some of the lime crema and toss until the salad is lightly coated. Add a little more lime crema on top just before serving.

step 0:
Add the roasted red peppers to a blender along with about 2 Tbsp of the liquid from the jar. Purée the peppers until smooth, adding a tablespoon or two of water if needed to help it blend (avoid adding too much liquid from the jar as it can be very acidic).
step 1:
Mince the garlic and add it to a skillet with the butter. Sauté the garlic in the butter over medium-low heat for 1-2 minutes, or just until the garlic has softened and becomes very fragrant (but not browned). Pour in the puréed peppers, and add the dried basil and some freshly cracked pepper. Stir to combine.
step 2:
Allow the sauce to come up to a simmer. Turn the heat down to low and let the sauce simmer for 10-15 minutes, stirring often, or until the mixture is thick (see photos below).
step 3:
Add the heavy cream to the skillet, stir until the sauce is smooth, and allow to heat through. Taste the sauce ad add salt if needed (I found the liquid from the jar added enough salt for me). Serve warm.

Add the sliced mushrooms, a pinch of salt and pepper, and continue to sauté until the mushrooms have released all their moisture and begin to brown on the edges (about 5-7 minutes).
step 2:
Add the sauce to the skillet. Stir the sauce as it heats, dissolving any browned bits off the bottom of the skillet. Once the sauce is heated through, add the spinach, and continue to stir and cook until the spinach has wilted (about 5 minutes more).
step 3:
Once the rigatoni has been cooked and drained, stir it into the skillet with the sauce and vegetables and allow everything to heat through.
step 4:
In a small bowl, stir together the ricotta, Parmesan, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Add the ricotta mixture to the skillet, in dollops over the surface. Gently fold the ricotta into the pasta, leaving it only about half mixed, so there are still pockets of ricotta within the sauce and pasta.
step 5:
Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella over the pasta, place a lid on the skillet, and let it heat over medium-low until the cheese is melted. If you want the cheese to brown a bit, place it under your oven's broiler (without a lid) and watch closely until it develops a few browned spots. Serve hot.

	unit: cup
step 0:
Pull the kale leaves from the stems. Take a handful at a time in one fist, then carefully pull back your fingers one inch at a time as you slice the bunched kale into fine shreds. Place the shredded kale in a colander and rinse well. Allow the kale to dry as you prepare the remaining ingredients.
step 1:
Cut the pita into 1-inch triangles. Place the pita triangles in a small bowl and drizzle with olive oil. Toss the pita until it is well coated in oil. Heat a small skillet over medium, then once the skillet is hot, add the pita. Cook and stir the pita until they are toasted and crunchy.
step 2:
Remove the pita from the skillet, then add the chopped walnuts. Stir and cook the walnuts in the dry skillet for 1-2 minutes, or just until they begin to smell toasty. Remove them from the skillet immediately to prevent burning.
step 3:
To assemble the salad, place the washed and dried kale in a large bowl. Add the toasted pita, walnuts, Parmesan, and golden raisins. Pour the champagne vinaigrette over top, then toss until everything is coated in dressing and Parmesan.
step 4:
Serve the salad immediately, or let it rest for 10-15 minutes to allow the dressing to slightly soften the kale.

	name: bunch cilantro
	amount: 1/4
	unit: n/a
	name: cooked jasmine rice
	amount: 2
	unit: cups
step 0:
Add the olive oil to a large pot. Dice the onion, mince the garlic, and grate or mince the ginger (I use a small-holed cheese grater). Sauté the onion, garlic, and ginger in the olive oil over medium heat for 2-3 minutes, or until the onions are soft and transparent. While the onions, garlic, and ginger are sautéing, peel and slice the carrots.
step 1:
Add the turmeric and red pepper to the pot and sauté for a minute more. Add the carrots to the pot, sauté for a minute more, then add the lentils and water. Place a lid on the pot, bring it up to a boil over high heat, then turn the heat down to low and simmer for 20 minutes.
step 2:
Toast the coconut flakes while the soup simmers. Add the coconut flakes to a dry skillet and place it over medium-low heat. Stir continuously as the flakes heat until they are about 50% golden brown (1-3 minutes). Remove the flakes from the hot skillet immediately to stop the toasting process.
step 3:
After 20 minutes the lentils should be soft and broken down. Stir the coconut milk into the soup. Use an immersion blender or carefully blend the warm soup in small batches until about half of the soup is puréed (or all of it if you want it completely smooth). Once blended, begin adding salt, 1/2 tsp at a time, until the soup is properly seasoned. I used 1.5 tsp or 1/2 Tbsp of salt. Also adjust the red pepper flakes, if desired.
step 4:
To serve the soup, ladle about 1.5 cups into a bowl and top with 1/2 cup cooked rice, some fresh cilantro leaves, and a sprinkle of toasted coconut flakes.

	name: Freshly cracked pepper 
	amount: n/a
	unit: n/a
	name: medium cheddar, shredded
	amount: 8
	unit: oz
step 0:
Take the broccoli out of the freezer and allow it to begin to thaw. Once it's soft enough to cut with a knife, cut the florets into smaller, bite-sized pieces.
step 1:
Cut the chicken breast into small 1/2-inch cubes. Season with salt and pepper. Heat a large skillet over medium, then add the olive oil and swirl to coat the surface. Add the chicken pieces and cook until slightly browned on the outside. Remove the chicken pieces to a large clean bowl.
step 2:
While the chicken is cooking, finely dice the onion, and peel and slice the carrots. Add the onion and carrots to the skillet after the chicken is removed and sauté until the onions are softened. Transfer the onions and carrots to the bowl with the chicken.
step 3:
Add the chopped broccoli florets (even if not fully thawed) and the cooked rice to the bowl with the chicken, onions, and carrots. Stir to combine, then add 1/2 of the shredded cheddar (about 1 cup) and stir to combine again. Set the mixture aside.
step 4:
Begin to preheat the oven to 350ºF and coat the inside of a 2 quart casserole dish with non-stick spray. Add the butter and flour to the same skillet used to cook the chicken and vegetables. Cook and whisk the butter and flour over medium heat until it begins to foam, then continue to stir and cook for one minute.
step 5:
Slowly whisk the chicken broth into the flour and butter mixture. Allow it to come up to a simmer, at which time it will thicken. Once thickened, whisk in the milk and allow it to come up to a simmer again. When it's thick enough to coat a spoon, season with smoked paprika, freshly cracked pepper, and salt.
step 6:
Pour the sauce over the rice mixture in the bowl and stir until everything is combined and coated in sauce. Transfer the mixture to the casserole dish. Sprinkle the remaining shredded cheese over the casserole.
step 7:
Bake the casserole, uncovered, for about 35 minutes or until it becomes golden brown around the edges. Serve hot.

	unit: cup
	name: chocolate chips
	amount: 1/2
	unit: cup
	name: large egg
	amount: 1
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Add the flour and salt to to a bowl or food processor. Cut the butter into 1 tablespoon chunks, and add it to the flour and salt. Pulse the food processor or use a pastry cutter to work the butter into the flour until the butter is in pieces the size of peas. Add just enough water to form a cohesive ball of dough, with no dry flour left on the bottom of the bowl (about 1/4 cup).
step 1:
Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and shape it into a rectangle. Roll the dough out until it is about twice it's original size, then fold it into thirds like a letter. Give the dough a quarter turn and roll it out once again. Repeat the rolling, folding, and turning sequence 5-6 times to create layers in the dough, making sure to flour the work surface as you go so the dough doesn't stick. After the final fold, wrap the dough in plastic and refrigerate for at least one hour or up to one day.
step 2:
After the dough has rested in the refrigerator, begin to preheat the oven to 400ºF. Roll the dough out to a rectangle, approximately 16x6 inches. Cut the rolled dough into three equal pieces horizontally, then cut each rectangle diagonally into two triangles. Place a few chocolate chips in the wide end of each triangle. Roll the triangles up, beginning with the wide end, and ending with the point. Bend each roll slightly into a crescent shape.
step 3:
Place the crescent rolls on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. In a small bowl, whisk together one egg with 1 Tbsp water. Brush the egg wash over each crescent roll. Bake the crescent rolls for 20-22 minutes, or until they're deep golden brown and slightly puffed. Serve warm.

Preheat the oven to 400ºF. Line a baking sheet with foil for easy clean up. Lay two wire racks over the foil to elevate the chicken pieces. Spritz the wire racks with oil for easy clean up, if desired.
step 1:
Pat the chicken pieces dry with paper towel, then season them with a pinch of salt and pepper. Place the chicken pieces in a bowl and dust with cornstarch. Toss the chicken in the cornstarch until they are fully and evenly coated. Arrange the coated chicken pieces on the prepared baking sheet so they are not touching.
step 2:
Bake the chicken in the preheated oven for 45-50 minutes, or until the chicken is golden brown and crispy.
step 3:
While the chicken is in the oven, prepare the raspberry balsamic sauce. Place the balsamic vinegar, raspberry jam, water, soy sauce, and ginger in a small sauce pot. Place the pot over medium-low heat and whisk the ingredients together until dissolved. Allow the sauce to come up to a boil, then boil for five minutes, whisking often, or until the mixture is thick an syrupy. Remove the sauce from the heat, then stir in the butter. Allow the sauce to cool (it will thicken further as it cools).
step 4:
When the chicken is finished baking, place the pieces in a large clean bowl. Pour the sauce over top, and add the sliced green onion. Toss the chicken until it is fully coated in sauce. Serve warm.

	unit: Tbsp
step 0:
Preheat the oven to 425ºF. Use a zester, microplane, or small-holed cheese grater to remove the zest from the lemon.
step 1:
Place the thawed berries in a bowl and add the sugar, cornstarch, about 1/2 tsp of the zest, and 1 Tbsp of the lemon juice. Stir to combine. Pour the prepared berries and all the juices into a small casserole dish (4 cup capacity).
step 2:
In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, sugar, salt, and another 1/2 tsp of the lemon zest. Cut the butter into small pieces, then add it to the flour mixture. Use your hands to work the butter into the flour until the butter is in very small pieces and the mixture resembles damp sand. Add the milk and stir until a slightly sticky dough forms.
step 3:
Drop the biscuit dough onto the berries in small pieces. It's okay if the dough does not completely cover the berries.
step 4:
Bake the cobbler in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the berries are bubbling up around the edges. To prevent messes from the berry juices bubbling over, place the casserole dish on a baking sheet covered with parchment to catch any spills.
step 5:
Serve warm topped with ice cream or whipped cream, if desired. Garnish with any remaining lemon zest.

	amount: 1/4
	unit: cup
	name: green onions, sliced
	amount: 2-3
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Mix the spicy peanut sauce first to allow the flavors time to blend. In a small bowl, combine the peanut butter, sriracha, soy sauce, brown sugar, and grated fresh ginger (use a small holed-cheese grater to grate about 1 tsp). Stir in one tablespoon of hot water at a time until the sauce is thin enough to drizzle. Set the sauce aside.
step 1:
Mince the garlic and grate another teaspoon of fresh ginger. Heat the cooking oil in a large skillet over medium flame. Add the garlic and ginger to the hot skillet and sauté for about one minute, or just until the garlic is softened. Add the pork and continue to sauté until the pork is cooked through and crumbled (about five minutes).
step 2:
While the pork is cooking, rinse the mushrooms then chop them into small pieces. Once the pork is cooked through, add the chopped mushrooms and continue to sauté until the mushrooms have wilted and released all their moisture (about five minutes).
step 3:
While the mushrooms are cooking, peel the carrot then shred it using a large-holed cheese grater. Finely dice the red bell pepper. Once the mushrooms have cooked down, add the shredded carrot, diced bell pepper, hoisin sauce, toasted sesame oil, and soy sauce to the skillet. Stir and cook until everything is coated in sauce and heated through. (The amount of soy sauce needed may vary depending on the brand of hoisin sauce used. Start with 1/2 Tbsp and add more to taste).
step 4:
To build the bowls, start with one cup cooked rice, then add 3/4-1 cup of the meat and vegetable mixture. Sprinkle a few sliced green onions on top, then drizzle 1-2 Tbsp of the spicy peanut sauce over everything. Finish with about 1 Tbsp of the chopped peanuts.

	name: whole milk (optional)
	amount: 1
	unit: cup
step 0:
Dice the onion and mince the garlic. Add the onion, garlic, and butter to a large soup pot. Sauté over a medium flame until the onions are soft and transparent (about 5 minutes).
step 1:
Add the flour to the pot and continue to stir and cook for 1-2 minutes. The flour will form a paste with the butter and onions and begin to coat the bottom of the pot. As soon as the flour that is stuck to the pot begins to turn slightly golden, remove it from the heat.
step 2:
Add the crushed tomatoes (with juices), roasted red peppers (without juices) and the flour paste from the soup pot to a food processor or blender. Blend until smooth, then return the contents to the soup pot.
step 3:
Add the vegetable broth, basil, thyme, and some freshly cracked pepper (10-15 cranks of a pepper mill) to the soup and stir to combine. Heat and stir over a medium flame until the soup begins to simmer. Use the spoon to help dissolve any flour stuck to the bottom of the pot as you stir.
step 4:
Once the soup begins to simmer, turn off the heat. Add the milk, if using, and stir to combine. Taste and add salt if needed (this will depend on the salt content of your broth).

	unit: oz
	name: cooked rice (optional)
	amount: 4
	unit: cups
step 0:
Peel the potato and cut it into one-inch cubes. Place the cubes in a sauce pot, add enough water to cover the potatoes by one inch, and bring the pot to a boil over high heat. Boil the potatoes for 5-7 minutes, or until they can easily be pierced with a fork. Drain the potatoes and set them aside.
step 1:
Dice the onion, mince the garlic, and peel and grate the ginger (use a small-holed cheese grater). Add the olive oil, onion, garlic, and ginger to a large deep skillet and sauté over medium heat until the onions are soft and transparent (3-5 minutes).
step 2:
Add the garam masala to the skillet and continue to sauté for about a minute more to toast the spices. It's okay if the spices begin to stick to the surface of the skillet slightly, but be sure not to let them burn.
step 3:
Add the crushed tomatoes and tomato paste to the skillet. Stir to dissolve the tomato paste into the crushed tomatoes and to dissolve the spices off the bottom of the skillet. Allow the sauce to heat through (about five minutes). Taste the sauce and add salt as needed (I added 1/2 tsp salt).
step 4:
Drain the chickpeas, then add them to the skillet along with the cooked potatoes. Stir everything to coat in the hot sauce, then heat through. Spoon the Chana Aloo Masala over cooked rice (or serve with naan), topped with chopped cilantro and a dollop of plain yogurt (regular or Greek style).

	unit: Tbsp
	name: Zest of one lemon 
	amount: n/a
	unit: n/a
step 0:
In a small bowl, stir together the ingredients for the balsamic marinade (olive oil, balsamic vinegar, garlic, brown sugar, soy sauce, Dijon, and some freshly cracked pepper).
step 1:
Cut the mushrooms, bell pepper, zucchini, and onion into one-inch cubes, or as close to that size as possible. Leave the grape tomatoes whole. Place the vegetables in a gallon-sized zip top bag and pour the marinade over top. Massage the bag to mix the vegetables with the marinade. Let them marinate for 30 minutes at room temperature, flipping the bag occasionally to redistribute the marinade.
step 2:
While the vegetables are marinating, begin the rice. Combine the uncooked rice, water, minced garlic, and salt in a medium pot. Place a lid on top and bring the pot up to a boil over high heat. As soon as it reaches a boil, turn the heat down to low and let the pot simmer for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, turn the heat off and let it rest for 5 more minutes, then fluff with a fork. Allow the rice to cool slightly.
step 3:
While the rice is cooking, prepare the lemon parsley mix. Pull the leaves from about 1/2 bunch of parsley. Finely chop the leaves until they appear minced. Use a zester, microplane, or small-holed cheese grater to remove the zest from one lemon. Combine the minced parsley, about 1/2 Tbsp lemon zest, and olive oil in a small bowl.
step 4:
When the rice has cooled just slightly, add the lemon parsley mix and fold gently until the rice is coated in parsley, lemon, and olive oil. Avoid vigorous stirring, as this can make the rice pasty.
step 5:
Adjust the oven rack to the second position from the top and preheat the broiler on high. Cover a large baking sheet with parchment. Spread the marinated vegetables out over the surface of the baking sheet. If they do not cover the sheet in a single layer, use two baking sheets to avoid over crowding.
step 6:
Broil the vegetables about 6-8 inches from the flame for 10 minutes, or until they achieve a subtle char on the edges. Every broiler is slightly different, so keep a close eye on them and turn the baking sheet as needed. For more even broiling, stir the vegetables half way through.
step 7:
Fill each bowl with a scoop of lemon parsley rice and a pile of the broiled balsamic vegetables.

	name: uncooked orzo 
	amount: 1.5
	unit: cups
	name: bunch parsley (optional)
	amount: 1/4
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Pat the chicken thighs dry with a paper towel, then sprinkle both sides with a pinch of salt and pepper. Heat the olive oil in a large, deep skillet over medium heat. Once the oil is hot and shimmering, add the chicken thighs with the skin side down. Cook the chicken thighs on each side until golden brown (about 5-7 minutes each side), then remove to a clean plate.
step 1:
Pour off the excess fat from the skillet, leaving just enough to sauté the garlic. Turn the heat down to medium-low, add the minced garlic, and sauté for about one minute, or just until the garlic is soft and very fragrant.
step 2:
Add the diced tomatoes (with juices), oregano, and some freshly cracked pepper. Stir the tomatoes, herbs, and olives to combine and allow the juices from the tomatoes to dissolve any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Roughly chop the kalamata olives, and add them to the skillet.
step 3:
Add the chicken broth and orzo to the skillet, and stir to combine. Nestle the browned chicken thighs down into the skillet, place a lid on the skillet and turn the heat up to medium-high. Allow the skillet to come to a boil, then turn the heat down to low, or the lowest temperature needed to maintain a gentle simmer. Let the skillet simmer for 15 minutes with the lid in place.
step 4:
Turn the heat off and let the skillet rest for 5 minutes. The tomatoes and olives will have risen to the top, so use a fork to gently stir or fluff the orzo, tomatoes, and olives back together. The orzo should be tender and slightly saucy. Pull the parsley leaves from the stems, roughly chop them, and sprinkle over top.

While the onion and garlic are sautéing, peel and slice the carrots. Add the carrots to the pot and continue to sauté for 3-5 minutes more.
step 1:
While the onion, garlic, and carrots are sautéing, pull the kale leaves from the woody stems and then rip or cut them into thin strips. Rinse the kale well under cool water in a colander. Add the rinsed kale to the pot and sauté until the kale has wilted down to half its volume (3-5 minutes).
step 2:
Chop or shred the chicken into bite sized pieces then add it to the pot along with the broth, nutmeg, basil, a generous does of freshly cracked pepper (about 20 cranks of a pepper mill), and a pinch of red pepper flakes.

Add the uncooked macaroni noodles and stir to combine. Place a lid on the pot, turn the heat up to medium high, and let the pot come up to a boil. Stir every other minute or so to loosen the noodles from the bottom of the pot as it heats up.
step 4:
When the pot reaches a boil, turn the heat down to low, or just above low, so it continues to gently simmer. Let the pot gently simmer for 12-15 minutes, or until the pasta is tender and the liquid is thick and saucy. Stir frequently as it simmers to make sure the pasta does not stick to the bottom of the pot.
step 5:
Once the pasta is tender, add the shredded cheddar and stir it in until melted. Serve hot.

step 0:
Make the dressing first to allow the flavors time to blend. In a small bowl combine the fresh lime juice, fish sauce, fresh grated ginger, and chili garlic sauce. Stir to combine, taste, and adjust the fish sauce, chili garlic sauce, or ginger to your liking. The dressing should be very potent.
step 1:
Add the ground pork to a large non-stick skillet along with 1/2 Tbsp canola oil and one minced clove of garlic. Cook the pork over medium heat, breaking it up into small pieces as it cooks, until it is cooked through (about five minutes). Drain off any excess fat and allow the pork to cool a few minutes, or until it is no longer hot.
step 2:
While the pork is cooking, peel and shred the carrot using a large holed cheese grater or mandolin. Slice the red onion into very thin strips. Pull the cilantro leaves from the stems.
step 3:
Transfer the cooled pork to a bowl, add the prepared dressing, and stir to combine. Add the shredded carrot, sliced red onion, cilantro, and peanuts. Stir to combine again. Serve the salad over a bed of cooked rice, shredded greens, or fill large lettuce leaves with the mixture for lettuce wraps.

	name: quartered artichoke hearts 
	amount: 15 oz.
	unit: can
	name: grated Parmesan 
	amount: 1/4
	unit: cup
step 0:
Mince the garlic and add it to a deep skillet with the butter. Sauté the garlic in the butter over medium heat for one to two minutes, or just until it's tender and fragrant.
step 1:
Add the chicken broth, milk, salt, some freshly cracked pepper, and the pasta to the skillet (break the pasta in half first for easy stirring). Make sure the pasta is fully submerged, then place a lid on the skillet. Allow the skillet to come to a simmer, then immediately turn the heat down to low.
step 2:
Allow the pasta to simmer in the liquid for about 12 minutes, or until it's al dente. Stir the pasta every few minutes to make sure it doesn't stick to the bottom. Adjust the heat if needed to make sure the liquid maintains a gentle simmer. While the pasta is simmering, drain the artichoke hearts and then roughly chop them into slightly smaller pieces.
step 3:
Once the pasta is tender, turn off the heat. The sauce may still be slightly thin, but it will continue to thicken and absorb as the rest of the ingredients are added. Add the spinach, a handful at a time, to the hot pasta and sauce and toss it in the pasta until it wilts.
step 4:
Stir the chopped artichoke hearts into the pasta. Sprinkle 2 Tbsp of grated Parmesan over the pasta, then stir slightly to incorporate the Parmesan. Top with an additional 2 Tbsp of Parmesan then serve.

step 0:
Mince the garlic and dice the onion. Sauté the onion and garlic with olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat until the onions are soft and transparent (3-5 minutes).
step 1:
While the onions and garlic are cooking, peel and dice the carrots, dice the celery, and slice the mushrooms. Once the onions are soft, add the carrots and celery to the skillet and continue to sauté until the celery begins to soften slightly (5 minutes).
step 2:
Finally, add the mushrooms, salt, thyme, smoked paprika, and freshly cracked pepper to the skillet. Continue to sauté until the mushrooms have fully softened (3-5 minutes). Add the tomato paste and flour to the skillet. Stir and cook the vegetables with the flour and tomato paste until the vegetables are coated and the pasty mixture begins to coat the bottom of the skillet (about 2 minutes).
step 3:
Add the vegetable broth to the skillet, stirring to dissolve the flour and tomato paste from the bottom of the skillet. Allow the broth to come up to a simmer, at which point it will become slightly thicker. Stir in the cooked lentils and frozen peas, and allow to mixture to heat through.
step 4:
Preheat the oven to 400ºF. Pour the vegetable mixture into a casserole dish, or use your skillet if it is oven safe. Spread the mashed potatoes out over the surface of the vegetables and gravy. Use your spoon to make a decorative pattern in the mashed potatoes, if desired.
step 5:
Bake the shepherd's pie in the fully preheated oven for 15 minutes, or until everything is heated through. To achieve a browned surface on the mashed potatoes (optional), turn on the oven's broiler (and place the pie under it, if not already), and watch closely until the top has browned to your liking.

step 0:
Bring a large pot of water to a boil, then add the gnocchi. Continue to boil for about three minutes, or until the gnocchi begin to float. Once they're all floating, drain the gnocchi in a colander.
step 1:
Mince the two cloves of garlic and add them to a large skillet with the olive oil. Sauté the garlic over medium heat for about one minute, or just until it's soft and fragrant. Once soft, add the drained gnocchi and continue to sauté until the gnocchi gets slightly golden brown and crispy on the outside (don't stir too often or you'll prevent it from browning and crisping).
step 2:
Once the gnocchi is slightly crispy, add the pasta sauce and frozen chopped greens. Stir to combine, then allow to heat through (about 5 minutes). Sprinkle the Parmesan over the skillet, then the shredded mozzarella. Place a lid on the skillet and allow the cheese to heat and melt. Once melted, the gnocchi is ready to serve.

step 0:
Preheat the oven to 400ºF. Line a baking sheet with parchment or foil for easy cleanup. Wash the sweet potatoes well, then prick the skins several times with a fork. Place the sweet potatoes on the prepared baking sheet and bake for 60 minutes, or until soft and oozing from the fork holes.
step 1:
While the sweet potatoes are baking, prepare the small batch of chili. Begin by adding the ground turkey and olive oil to a large pot and sautéing the turkey over medium heat until cooked through (about 5 minutes).
step 2:
While the turkey is browning, dice the onion and mince the garlic. Add the onion and garlic to the browned turkey and continue to sauté until the onions are soft and transparent (3-5 minutes).
step 3:
Drain the beans and add them to the pot along with the tomato sauce, tomato paste, chili powder, oregano, cumin, and water. Stir to combine. Allow the chili to come up to a simmer, then reduce the heat and let simmer for 15 minutes. Taste and add salt if needed.
step 4:
Once the sweet potatoes are finished baking, carefully slice each one open lengthwise and slightly mash the insides. Scoop about 3/4 cup chili over each potato, then top with 2 Tbsp shredded cheddar. Return the potatoes to the oven for a few minutes to melt the cheese. Add cilantro or sliced green onions to the top just before serving.

	name: grated Parmesan
	amount: 1
	unit: Tbsp
	name: Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste 
	amount: n/a
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Use a vegetable peeler to remove the tough skin from the lower portion of the thick broccoli stems. Cut the florets off the crown, including a 1 to 2-inch spear of stem on each (see photos below). Use a microplane, zester, or fine cheese grater to remove the yellow zest from the lemon. Set the zest aside.
step 1:
Add one to two inches of water to the bottom of a medium sauce pot. Place a steaming basket in the pot, then add the broccoli. Place a lid on the pot and heat the water over high flame until it begins to steam. Steam the broccoli for about five minutes, or until it is bright green and can be pierced with a fork, but is still slightly crisp. Remove the broccoli from the heat and remove the lid to prevent further cooking.
step 2:
While the broccoli is steaming, mince two cloves of garlic and add them to a large skillet along with the the olive oil. Sauté the garlic over medium heat for one to two minutes, or just until soft and fragrant. Turn the heat off if needed, to wait for the broccoli to finish steaming.
step 3:
Once the broccoli is finished steaming, transfer it from the sauce pot to the skillet with the oil and garlic. Squeeze a small amount of lemon juice over top, then toss to coat in the infused oil. Season to taste with salt and freshly cracked pepper, then top with grated parmesan and a pinch of the lemon zest.
step 4:
OPTIONAL: Place the skillet under the broiler for a minute or two to toast the parmesan and crisp the edges of the broccoli, for a slightly nutty/smoky flavor. Make sure to only do this with an oven safe skillet.

	unit: oz.
	name: pasta sauce 
	amount: 24
	unit: oz.
	name: shredded mozzarella 
	amount: 1
	unit: cup
step 0:
Slice the eggplant into 1/2-inch thick slices. Generously sprinkle salt over the slices and let them sit in a colander for 45-60 minutes. This will pull some of the water and bitterness out of the eggplant. After salting, gently press the slices between paper towels to blot the excess water away.
step 1:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Place the slices in a large zip top bag, add the flour, and shake until the slices are coated in flour.
step 2:
In a shallow bowl, whisk together the egg and milk. In a second shallow bowl, stir together the breadcrumbs, Parmesan, and garlic powder. Dip each slice of eggplant into the egg wash first, then in the seasoned breadcrumbs until coated on both sides. Place the breaded slices onto a baking sheet with two wire cooling racks placed on top (to elevate the slices).
step 3:
Bake the breaded slices for 25 minutes, or until golden brown and crispy. While the slices are baking, cook the pasta according to the package directions. Drain the pasta, return it to the pot (with the heat turned off) and add the pasta sauce. Stir to coat.
step 4:
Once the eggplant slices are finished baking, reserve a few to top the casserole and cut the remaining slices into 1/2-inch squares. Stir the eggplant squares into the pasta and sauce. Pour the pasta, sauce, and eggplant into a casserole dish or oven safe skillet, then top with the whole eggplant slices and the shredded mozzarella.
step 5:
Bake the casserole in the still hot oven until the cheese is melted and the dish is heated through (10-15 minutes). If you prefer the cheese to be browned, place the dish under the broiler for 1-2 minutes, or until the desired browning has been achieved.

step 0:
Thinly slice the cabbage, mushrooms, and the green onions (both the green and white ends of the onions). Peel the carrots, then either slice them thinly, use a vegetable peeler to slice them into ribbons, or cut them into thin sticks (julienne).
step 1:
Add the canola oil, grated ginger, and the sliced white ends of the green onion to a large pot. Sauté the ginger and onion over medium heat until soft (1-2 minutes). Add the vegetable broth to the pot, along with the soy sauce, vinegar, and chili garlic sauce. The amount of soy sauce, vinegar, and chili garlic sauce needed may be subjective and will depend on how much salt your vegetable broth contains. Start with a smaller amount of each, then add more to your taste. The final broth should be tangy and spicy. Heat the broth until piping hot.
step 2:
Drain the tofu, then cut it into small cubes (small enough to fit on a spoon). Add the tofu to the hot broth, and allow it to heat through ( a few minutes).
step 3:
Either add the sliced vegetables to the soup pot and cook until softened, or divide the vegetables into individual bowls for serving, then spoon the hot broth over top. Sprinkle the sliced green portion of the green onions over each bow. More chili garlic sauce can also be added to each bowl if desired.

step 0:
In a small bowl, combine the soy sauce, water, rice wine, brown sugar, sesame oil, garlic, ginger, sesame seeds, and cornstarch. Stir until the cornstarch is dissolved.
step 1:
Remove the scales and/or skin from the salmon, if needed. Cut the salmon into three equal sized pieces and place them in a quart-sized zip top bag. Add about half of the marinade to the bag and let the fish marinate for about 15 minutes. Save the second half of the marinade for later.
step 2:
While the fish is marinating, snap the stems off the beans and break any long beans in half. Rinse the beans in a colander. Add the beans to a medium sauce pot, cover with water, add a lid, and bring to a boil over high heat. Allow the beans to boil until bright green and slightly tender (about 3 minutes), then drain in the colander and set aside.
step 3:
Lightly mist a non-stick skillet with non-stick spray and heat over medium-low flame. Once hot, add the salmon pieces and cook on each side until the glaze turns deep brown and the fish is cooked through (about 3-5 minutes each side). Removed the cooked salmon to a clean plate.
step 4:
Add the drained green beans to the skillet that was used to cook the salmon, along with the remaining unused marinade. Sauté the green beans in the marinade until it thickens to a shiny glaze and completely coats the green beans (about 3 minutes). Serve the fish on top of the glazed green beans.

step 0:
Mince the garlic and dice the onion. Sauté the onion and garlic with olive oil over medium heat in a deep skillet until the onion are soft and transparent (about 3-5 minutes).
step 1:
Add the smoked paprika, oregano, cumin, and dry rice to the skillet. Stir and cook over medium heat for about 2 minutes to toast the rice and spices. You should hear the rice popping and it should begin to look slightly transparent.
step 2:
Drain the chickpeas and add them to the skillet along with the frozen spinach (no need to thaw). Zest the lemon and set the zest aside. Squeeze about 2 Tbsp of the lemon's juice into the skillet. Add the vegetable broth and stir the ingredients to combine.
step 3:
Place a lid on the skillet and turn the heat up to medium-high. Allow it to come to a boil, then immediately turn it down to low or just above low. Let the skillet continue to simmer for 20 minutes, with the lid in place. After 20 minutes, turn the heat off and let it sit undisturbed for an additional 5 minutes.
step 4:
Remove the lid and fluff the skillet with a fork to redistribute the chickpeas and spinach. Sprinkle the lemon zest and crumbled feta over the skillet just before serving.

	amount: 1/2
	unit: Tbsp
step 0:
Adjust your oven rack to the highest level. Begin to preheat the oven to 500 degrees.
step 1:
To make the white sauce, combine the butter and flour in a small sauce pot. Heat the butter and flour over medium-low heat, while whisking, until it begins to simmer. Simmer and whisk the mixture for about one minute.
step 2:
Whisk the milk into the butter and flour mixture. Allow it to come up to a simmer again, whisking often. When it reaches a simmer, it will thicken. Turn off the heat and whisk in the garlic and salt. Set the sauce aside to cool (it will thicken further as it cools).
step 3:
Prepare a 12-inch pizza pan with non-stick spray and/or cornmeal. Stretch the pizza dough out to cover the surface of the pizza pan. Pour the white sauce over the surface and spread it out with the back of a spoon. Bake the crust with the sauce for 5 minutes.
step 4:
Squeeze any excess moisture out of the spinach, then sprinkle the spinach over the surface of the par-baked pizza crust and sauce, followed by half of the mozzarella. Crack the four eggs onto the pizza, equally spaced around the surface. Add a small amount of freshly cracked pepper, then top the remainder of the mozzarella.
step 5:
Bake the pizza for 10-12 minutes, or until the cheese and crust are golden brown and the eggs are mostly set. Allow the pizza to cool for five minutes before slicing (the eggs will continue to firm up after it comes out of the oven).

step 0:
Cut the zucchini into small cubes. Rinse and drain the black beans. Slice the green onions (both green and white portions). Pull the cilantro leaves from the stems and give them a rough chop. Combine the zucchini, black beans, frozen corn kernels, green onions, cilantro, and diced green chiles in a bowl. Add 1/4 tsp salt and stir until evenly combined.
step 1:
To make the enchilada sauce, combine the oil, chili powder, and flour in a small sauce pot. Whisk them together over medium heat and allow it to begin to bubble. Let the mixture bubble while whisking for about one minute. Add the water, tomato paste, cumin, garlic, cayenne, and salt. Whisk until smooth. Heat the sauce until thick and bubbly (about 3-5 minutes).
step 2:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Prepare a 9x9 casserole dish by coating lightly with non-stick spray. Spread a 1/2 cup of the sauce in the bottom of the dish. Arrange 1/3 of the tortillas over the sauce, followed by 1/3 of the vegetable mixture. Drizzle 1/2 cup of the sauce over the vegetables, then top with 1/2 cup cheese. Repeat these layers two more times, or until the vegetable mix, sauce, and cheese are gone.
step 3:
Bake the casserole for 40-45 minutes, or until the edges are bubbly and the cheese just begins to brown on top. Slice into six portions and top with extra green onions and cilantro, if desired.

	unit: n/a
step 0:
The night before, place the beans in a large bowl and add enough cool water to cover the beans by 2-3 inches. Let the beans soak in the refrigerator over night.
step 1:
The next day, cut the bacon into one-inch pieces. Cook the bacon in a large pot over medium heat until brown and crispy. Remove the bacon to a paper towel lined plate and pour off most of the grease, leaving a tablespoon or two in the pot.
step 2:
While the bacon is cooking, dice the onion and mince the garlic. Peel and slice the carrots, and slice the celery. Sauté the onion, garlic, carrots, and celery in the leftover bacon grease over medium heat until the onions are soft and transparent (about five minutes). Use the moisture from the vegetables to help dissolve the browned bits of bacon from the bottom of the pot.
step 3:
While the vegetables are sautéing, peel the potatoes then cut them into 1/2-inch cubes. Drain the soaked beans in a colander and rinse them briefly.
step 4:
Add the cubed potatoes, rinsed beans, and chicken broth to the pot. Cover the pot and bring it up to a boil. Reduce the heat slightly and let the pot boil gently for one hour, or until the beans and potatoes are very soft.
step 5:
Use an immersion blender to purée about half of the soup, leaving some beans and vegetables whole. If you don't have an immersion blender, remove half of the soup from the pot, let it cool slightly, then use a blender or food processor to carefully purée the warm soup. Return the puréed soup to the pot and stir to combine with the rest.
step 6:
Add the tomato sauce and reserved bacon to the soup. Stir and heat until warm. Taste the soup and add salt and pepper if needed. Serve hot.

step 1:
Bring a large pot of water to a boil for the pasta. Once boiling, add the pasta and continue to boil until the pasta is al dente. Drain in a colander, then rinse with cool water to bring the temperature down. Allow the pasta to drain and dry in the colander until tacky on the surface (stir occasionally to increase evaporation).
step 2:
While the pasta is cooking, add the sausage to a non-stick skillet and cook over medium-low heat until the links are firm enough to slice. Remove the sausage to a cutting board and slice into medallions. Return the sliced sausage to the skillet and continue cooking until the sausage is browned on all sides.
step 3:
Thinly slice the bell peppers and cut the mozzarella into small cubes.
step 4:
Add the cooled and drained pasta to a large bowl along with the arugula, sliced peppers, cheese cubes, and cooked sausage. Pour the dressing over top, then toss to coat. Serve immediately or refrigerate until ready to eat. If refrigerated, toss the salad just before serving.

	name:  dired basil
	amount: 1/2
	unit: tsp
	name: garlic powder
	amount: 1/8
	unit: tsp
step 0:
To prepare the pizza sauce, combine the tomato sauce, tomato paste, oregano, basil, and garlic powder in a bowl. Stir until the tomato paste is dissolved in the tomato sauce. Warm the sauce in the microwave or in a small pot to help them combine, if necessary. Set the sauce aside to allow the flavors to blend while you prepare the rest of the pizza toppings.
step 1:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Brown the Italian sausage and pour off any excess grease. Thaw the frozen spinach and squeeze out as much moisture as possible. Slice the Roma tomatoes. Grate the mozzarella cheese (if not pre-shredded).
step 2:
Cut the loaf of French bread into three equal sections (about 6-7 inches in length, each). Slice each piece open as if to build a sandwich. Place the six pieces of bread cut side up on two baking sheets. Spoon the sauce onto the surface of each piece and spread it to cover edge to edge.
step 3:
Divide half of the shredded cheese between the six pieces of bread, then top with the browned sausage, spinach, sliced tomatoes, olives, and mushrooms. Top the pizzas with the second half of the cheese. Lightly press the toppings into the French bread, if needed, to help keep them from falling off.
step 4:
Bake the pizzas in a preheated 375 degree oven for 15 minutes, or until the cheese is melty and lightly golden brown. If you intend to eat the pizzas later, bake half way (until the cheese is melted and "glues" the toppings down) then let the pizzas cool at room temperature.

	name: pasta (any shape)
	amount: 1
	unit: lb
	name: fried eggs (optional)
	amount: 5
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Rinse the parsley and drain well. Pull the leaves from the stems and place them in a food processor with the Parmesan, garlic, salt, zest and juice from half the lemon (about 2 Tbsp juice). Pulse the ingredients until they are finely chopped. Slowly add the olive oil through the spout while the processor is running until a smooth paste forms. Set the pesto aside.
step 1:
Heat a large skillet over medium flame. Add one tablespoon olive oil, then tilt the skillet to coat the surface. Add the tomatoes and cook 7-10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Avoid stirring the tomatoes too often to allow them time to blister on the hot skillet. As they cook the skins will burst and the tomatoes will release juice, which will thicken into a semi-sweet glaze. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
step 2:
Bring a large pot of water to a boil for the pasta. Cook the pasta in the boiling water according to the package directions, or until al dente. Reserve a small amount of the starchy cooking water, then drain the pasta in a colander. Allow the pasta to cool slightly, then return it to the pot (with the heat turned off). Add the pesto, then toss to coat. If the pasta is too dry or clumps, sprinkle a little of the reserved cooking water on top to loosen.
step 3:
Divide the pasta among five bowls, top with a scoop of the blistered cherry tomatoes, scraping up some of the sweet glaze from the skillet as well. Top each bowl with a fried egg, if desired.

	unit: Tbsp
step 0:
Mince the garlic and dice the onion, celery, and carrots. Sauté the garlic, onion, celery, and carrots with the vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat until the onions are soft and transparent (about five minutes).
step 1:
Add the chicken breast, chicken broth, 2 cups water, some freshly cracked pepper, and one or two sprigs of dill to the pot. Place a lid on the pot and let it come up to a boil. Once it reaches a boil, turn the heat down to low and let it simmer for 30 minutes.
step 2:
While the soup is simmering, mix the matzo ball dough. In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs and vegetable oil. Add the matzo meal, salt, baking powder, and a little freshly cracked pepper to the eggs and oil. Stir until well combined. Finally, add 3 Tbsp water and stir until smooth again. Refrigerate the mixture for 30 minutes to allow the matzo meal time to absorb the moisture.
step 3:
After the chicken soup has simmered, carefully remove the chicken breast and shred it with a fork. Return the shredded chicken to the soup. Taste the broth and adjust the salt if needed.
step 4:
Once the matzo ball mix has refrigerated and stiffened up, begin to form it into ping pong sized balls. Drop the balls into the simmering soup as they are formed, returning the lid to the pot after each one. Once all the matzo balls are in the soup, let them simmer for 20 minutes without removing the lid. Make sure the soup is gently simmering the entire time.
step 5:
Add a couple sprigs of fresh dill just before serving.

	name: Pinch red pepper flakes (optional)
	amount: n/a
	unit: n/a
	name: shredded mozzarella
	amount: 1
	unit: cup
step 0:
Begin the dough the night before. In a large bowl stir together the flour, salt, and yeast. Combine the olive oil and 3/4 cup water, then pour it into the bowl with the flour. Stir until a single (slightly wet and sticky) ball of dough forms with no dry flour left on the bottom of the bowl. Add one to two tablespoons more of water, if needed, to form a ball of dough. Loosely cover the dough and let it sit at room temperature for 12-18 hours.
step 1:
The next day let the spinach thaw and then squeeze out as much moisture as possible. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees and pour 1 Tbsp of vegetable oil into a 10 or 12-inch cast iron skillet. Spread the oil around the skillet, including up the side walls.
step 2:
To make the sauce, mince the garlic and add it to a small pot along with the butter. Sauté the butter and garlic for 1-2 minutes over medium-low heat, or until the garlic is soft and fragrant. Add the cream cheese, milk, and salt to the butter and garlic. Whisk and cook over medium-low heat until the cream cheese has melted into the milk and a thick sauce forms (3-5 minutes). Finally, stir the squeeze-dried spinach into the sauce, breaking up any clumps as you stir. Remove the sauce from the heat and set aside.
step 3:
Use the excess oil from the skillet to coat your hands, then scrape the fermented dough out of the bowl. Gently press and stretch the loose dough into the skillet until it evenly covers the bottom.
step 4:
Spread the creamy spinach sauce over the dough, covering from edge to edge. Drain the artichoke hearts, give them a rough chop, then sprinkle over the creamy spinach sauce. Add a pinch of red pepper flakes, if desired. Finally, top the pizza with the shredded mozzarella.
step 5:
Bake the pizza in the fully preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the edges are sizzling and the top is golden brown. Remove the pizza from the oven and slide a butter knife around the edges to loosen any melted cheese. Either slide the whole pizza onto a cutting board or carefully slice the pizza in the pan. Cut into six slices and serve.

Slice the green onions and add them to the bowl along with the chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, and salt. Stir until the beans are evenly seasoned.
step 1:
Add the ground turkey to the seasoned black beans. Mix well using your hands. Form 10 small patties (about 2-2.5 inches diameter, 1/2 inch thick). Place the patties on a roasting pan or a baking sheet covered with foil and wire cooling racks.
step 2:
Bake the patties in the preheated oven for 20 minutes, or until browned on the outside and no longer pink in the center. Alternatively, you can cook the patties in a skillet, on a grill, or using an indoor countertop grill.
step 3:
While the patties are baking, prepare the avocado sauce. Add the avocado (diced), juice from half a lime (about 2 Tbsp), garlic powder, salt, sugar, sour cream, and 2-4 Tbsp of water to a blender. Blend the ingredients together, adding the water slowly until a smooth, thick sauce forms.
step 4:
Smear some of the sauce inside each pita half, add a couple tomato slices, and two of the turkey patties.

If your mustard greens did not come pre-cut and with stems removed, run a sharp knife down the center of each leaf to remove the woody stems. Cut the remaining leaves into 2-inch strips. Rinse the cut leaves well in a colander.
step 1:
Slice the onion thinly and mince the garlic. Sauté the onion and garlic in a large pot over medium heat with the olive oil until the onions are soft (about 5 minutes). Add the vegetable broth and heat until steaming.
step 2:
Add the cut mustard greens, a couple handfuls at a time, stirring until wilted and there is room to add more to the pot. Once they're all mostly wilted, add the smoked paprika, sugar, some freshly cracked pepper, and a pinch of red pepper flakes, if desired.
step 3:
Place a lid on the pot, allow the broth to come to a simmer, then turn down to medium-low. Let the pot simmer for at least 30 minutes, or longer if desired. Taste the greens and adjust the salt, pepper, or sugar if needed (if your broth is low-sodium, you may want to add salt at this time). Serve the greens with a slotted spoon to leave the excess broth behind.

step 0:
Place the beans in a large pot and cover with water. Soak the beans overnight in the refrigerator OR, place the beans in a large pot, cover with water, and bring to a boil over high heat. Boil for one minute, turn the heat off and let the beans sit, covered, for one hour. Drain the beans in a colander.
step 1:
Mince the garlic and dice the onion, celery, and bell peppers. Pull the parsley leaves from the stems and give them a rough chop.
step 2:
Add the olive oil, garlic, and onion to a large pot and sauté over medium heat until the onions begin to turn transparent (3-5 minutes). Add the celery and bell peppers and sauté a few minutes more, or just until they begin to soften.
step 3:
Remove the skin from the chicken thighs (if they came with skin) and trim the excess fat if desired. Nestle the chicken thighs down into the sautéed vegetables.
step 4:
Add the soaked beans, a handful of the parsley (the rest will be used later), Creole seasoning, oregano, smoked paprika, some cracked pepper, and six cups of water. Stir gently to distribute the spices, but not to disturb the thighs.
step 5:
Cover the pot and bring it to a boil over high heat. Once it reaches a full boil, turn the heat down to low and let it simmer for two hours. Make sure the pot is simmering the whole time, increasing the heat slightly if needed to help it maintain a simmer.
step 6:
After two hours, test the beans to make sure they are soft. Remove the chicken thighs and use two forks to shred the meat and remove the bones (if using bone-in thighs).
step 7:
Use a large wooden spoon to smash the beans against the side of the pot to help the liquid thicken. Taste the beans and adjust the salt or Creole seasoning if desired. Return the shredded chicken to the pot and top with fresh parsley. Serve alone or over a bed of rice.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Mince the garlic and add it to a 10" oven safe skillet, along with the canola oil. Sauté over medium heat for 1-2 minutes, or just until the garlic is soft and fragrant. Fill the skillet with fresh spinach (about 3-4 cups packed) and continue to sauté until it has wilted (1-2 minutes).
step 1:
Remove the peppers from the jar and slice into thin strips. Add the sliced peppers to the skillet and sauté for 1-2 minutes more. Season the vegetables with salt, pepper, and a pinch of red pepper flakes if desired. Remove from the heat and crumble the feta over top.
step 2:
Whisk together the eggs and milk, adding a pinch of salt and pepper. Pour the eggs over the vegetables in the skillet, then transfer the skillet to the fully preheated oven.
step 3:
Bake the frittata for 20-25 minutes, or until the center is puffed and the top is light golden brown. If more browning is desired, place the frittata under the broiler for 1-2 minutes. This will quickly brown the top without over cooking the egg inside. Slice into 6-8 pieces and serve (1-2 pieces per person depending on size and appetite).

	unit: cup
	name: grated Parmesan
	amount: 1/4
	unit: cup
	name: pasta sauce
	amount: 24 oz
	unit: jar
step 0:
Boil a large pot of water. Once the water is boiling, add the lasagna noodles and boil just until tender. Drain the pasta in a colander and set aside.
step 1:
While the lasagna noodles are boiling, prepare the vegetable mix. Mince the garlic and dice the onion. Add the canola oil to a large skillet, along with the garlic and onion, and sauté over medium heat until the onions are transparent.
step 2:
While the onions are cooking, rinse and thinly slice the mushrooms. Add the mushrooms to the skillet and continue to sauté. While the mushrooms are cooking, grate the zucchini and carrots on a large holed cheese grater. Add the zucchini and carrots to the skillet, along with the oregano, about 1/4 tsp salt, and some freshly cracked pepper. Continue to sauté until most of the moisture has evaporated (juice should no longer pool on the bottom of the skillet). Remove the skillet from the heat and allow it to cool slightly.
step 3:
Next, prepare the cheese mix. In a large bowl, combine the ricotta, mozzarella, Parmesan, and 1/4 tsp salt. Stir until they are evenly combined. Add the slightly cooled sautéed vegetables and stir to combine again. Taste and adjust the salt or pepper if needed.
step 4:
Carefully lay out a few lasagna noodles at a time on a flat surface. Add approximately 1/3 cup of the vegetable and cheese mixture to each noodle, then spread the mixture from end to end, leaving about a 1/2 inch bare at each end of the noodle. Once covered in the filling, roll the noodles up. You should get approximately finished 12 roll ups (you may have extra noodles).
step 5:
To bake the roll ups, preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Coat a 9x9 casserole dish with non-stick spray. Spread about 1/4 of the pasta sauce in the bottom of the casserole dish, then arrange the roll ups on top. Pour the remaining sauce over top. Bake for 40 minutes, or until heated through.
step 6:
To freeze the roll ups, Place two roll ups each in a freezer and microwave safe container, then pour sauce over top. Freeze for up to three months. Reheat in the microwave when ready to eat.

	unit: Tbsp
	name: large marshmallows
	amount: 10
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Place three whole graham crackers (rectangles, not the square half) and place them in a zip top bag. Use a rolling pin to crush the graham crackers into crumbs.
step 1:
Melt the butter in a medium bowl. Once melted, stir in the sugar and graham cracker crumbs. Stir the mixture until it looks like damp, coarse sand. Divide the mixture between two 8oz. ramekins and use the back of a spoon to pack the mixture into a solid layer.
step 2:
Drop about 1 Tbsp of peanut butter onto each graham cracker crust, followed by a sprinkle of chocolate chips (1 to 1.5 Tbsp for each ramekin). Arrange the marshmallows in a single layer in the ramekin. Use enough marshmallows so that they are touching each other, but not packed in tight. They will spread as they melt.
step 3:
Bake the s'mores pots for 15 minutes, or until the marshmallows are puffy and light golden brown. Serve hot (use a pot holder or wrap the ramekin in a towel because it will be hot!).

step 2:
Heat a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the vegetable oil to the hot skillet and tilt the skillet until the bottom is coated in oil. Add the vegetables to the skillet, then stir continuously as they cook. Cook the vegetables only until the broccoli turns bright green and the onions just begin to soften (3-5 minutes). You want the vegetables to retain some crunch in the center.
step 3:
Finally, add the sauce and cashews to the skillet. Stir until everything is coated in sauce and heated through (1-2 minutes). Serve immediately over rice. Top with sliced green onions if desired.

	unit: n/a
	name: small (taco sized) tortillas
	amount: 8
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Prepare the crema first to allow the flavors time to blend. Mince one clove of garlic and use a zester or small holed cheese grater to scrape the thin layer of green zest from the lime. Add the minced garlic, 1 tsp of the zest, about 1 tsp of the lime juice, and 1/4 tsp salt to the sour cream. Stir the ingredients to combine then refrigerate until ready to use.
step 1:
Peel the sweet potatoes, then cut them into small cubes (about 1/4 to 1/2 inch square). Heat a large skillet over medium flame, then add the olive oil and two cloves of minced garlic. Sauté the garlic for about a minute or just until it becomes fragrant. Add the diced sweet potato and a couple tablespoons of water. Sauté the sweet potato until they become soft and just begin to fall apart. Add another couple tablespoons of water during cooking if the skillet becomes dry before the sweet potatoes are soft.
step 2:
Meanwhile, drain and rinse the can of black beans. Once the sweet potatoes are soft, add the black beans to the skillet. Season with the cumin, and salt and pepper to taste. Sauté just until the beans are heated through.
step 3:
Slice the green onions and pull the cilantro leaves from the stems. Roughly chop the cilantro. Stir the sliced green onions into the skillet. Add the cilantro to the skillet if desired, or use it to top each taco.
step 4:
Prior to filling each tortilla, heat them in a dry skillet until slightly browned and crisp on each side, or carefully toast them over an open flame. Smear a small amount of the lime crema down the center of the tortilla, then top with a scoop of the sweet potato and black bean hash. Add fresh cilantro if desired.

step 0:
Remove the stems from the kale leaves by running a sharp knife along each side of the stem from top to bottom. Stack the de-stemmed leaves, then cut crosswise into thin strips. Place the chopped kale into a colander and rinse well with cool water. Let as much water drain away as possible. Use a salad spinner of blot with a clean, lint-free towel to remove as much moisture as possible. Place the cleaned and dried kale into a large bowl.
step 1:
Drain and rinse the chickpeas. Peel the carrots, then shred them using a large holed cheese grater. Remove the chicken meat from the carcass, then roughly chop into small pieces. Add the chickpeas, carrots, chopped chicken, and Parmesan to the bowl with the kale.
step 2:
Add 1/4 cup Caesar dressing to the bowl, then stir until everything is evenly coated. Add one heaping cup of the salad mix to the center of a large tortilla. Add some freshly cracked pepper, if desired. Fold in the sides of the tortilla, then roll it up like a burrito. Serve immediately or refrigerate up to a day.

step 0:
Prepare the dressing first by combining the oil, vinegar, honey, soy sauce, ginger, garlic powder, sesame oil, and pepper in a jar or bowl. Shake the jar or whisk the ingredients in a bowl until combined. The dressing will separate a bit as it sits, but will be stirred again prior to adding to the salad.
step 1:
Rinse the cabbage well and shake off as much excess moisture as possible. Slice the cabbage into thin strips and add it to a bowl (about 8 cups of shredded cabbage). Peel the carrots and then shred them using a large holed cheese grater. Slice the green onions. Add the carrots, green onions, and almonds to the bowl.
step 2:
Before opening the package of ramen, crush the noodles using the heel of your hand. Open the package, discard the seasoning envelope, and add the crushed noodles to the bowl.
step 3:
Pull the meat from half of a rotisserie chicken, then chop it into small pieces (or use two cups of pre-cooked chopped chicken). Add the chicken to the bowl. Give the dressing a brief stir, then pour it over the salad ingredients in the bowl. Stir until everything is evenly coated in dressing, then serve.

	amount: 2
	unit: cups
	name: salt 
	amount: 1
	unit: tsp
step 0:
Adjust the oven rack to its highest position. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees, or its highest setting.
step 1:
Dissolve the sugar and yeast into the warm water and let it sit until foamy (about 5 minutes).
step 2:
While the yeast is soaking, combine 1 cup of the flour and the salt in a separate large bowl. Stir until the salt is evenly mixed into the flour.
step 3:
Pour the yeast water into the bowl of flour, then stir with a wooden spoon until fairly smooth. Stir in an additional 1/2 cup flour. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for 5 minutes, slowly adding up to 1/2 cup more flour as you go. Be sure to add the flour slowly as you knead to prevent it from becoming too dry and stiff.
step 4:
Let the dough rest for 5 minutes. Divide it into two equal portions and form each piece into a ball. If you do not wish to make two pizzas immediately, the second ball of dough can be wrapped in plastic and stored in the refrigerator for up to two days, or frozen for up to 3 months.
step 5:
Press the dough down into a flattened circular disk, then use a rolling pin to roll it out into a thin circle, about 12 inches in diameter and 1/8 inch thick.
step 6:
Prepare a pizza pan with either non-stick spray or a combination of spray and cornmeal, then carefully place the dough onto the pan. Spread a thin layer of your favorite sauce over the surface, then bake in the preheated oven for 5 minutes, or just until the edges develop a hint of color.
step 7:
Remove the crust from the oven, add the rest of your toppings, then bake for an additional 7-10 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and the crust is a medium golden brown.

step 0:
Mince the garlic. Peel the ginger with a vegetable peeler or by scraping the skin with the sharp side of a spoon. Use a small holed cheese grater to grate the ginger. Add the garlic, ginger, the juice from half the lime (1.5-2 Tbsp), chili garlic sauce, soy sauce, honey, sesame oil, and vegetable oil to a medium bowl. Whisk together. Add the peanut butter and hot water, then whisk again until fairly smooth. Roughly chop the cilantro. Save a handful of the cilantro to top the dish after baking, and stir the rest into the peanut sauce.
step 1:
Set aside 1/2 cup of the peanut sauce for later. Add the remaining peanut sauce to a gallon sized zip top bag along with the chicken pieces. Remove as much air from the bag as possible, close it up tightly, and massage the bag to mix the marinade with the chicken. Marinate the chicken in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes, or up to overnight.
step 2:
When you're ready to cook the chicken, preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Place the chicken pieces and all the marinade from the bag in a casserole dish so that the pieces are in a single layer. Bake the chicken in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, then use a brush to add the reserved peanut sauce to the top of the chicken. Cook for an additional 15 minutes, then use a meat thermometer to test the internal temperature. If it's not up to 160 degrees Fahrenheit, bake 10-15 minutes more and then test again. Repeat until the internal temperature reaches 160 degrees Fahrenheit.
step 3:
Top the baked chicken with the reserved cilantro and serve.

	name: frozen chopped spinach 
	amount: 1/4
	unit: lb.
step 0:
Place the frozen spinach in a colander to thaw while you work on the pasta and sauce.
step 1:
Bring a large pot of water to a boil and then add the pasta. Let the pasta boil until al dente, then drain in a colander. Reserve about 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water to help loosen the sauce later if needed.
step 2:
While the pasta is boiling, prepare the ricotta sauce. Mince the garlic and add it to a large skillet with the olive oil. Cook over medium-low heat for 1-2 minutes, or just until soft and fragrant (but not browned). Add the milk and ricotta, then stir until relatively smooth (the ricotta may be slightly grainy). Allow the sauce to heat through and come to a low simmer. The sauce will thicken slightly as it simmers. Once it's thick enough to coat the spoon (3-5 minutes), season with salt and pepper.
step 3:
Squeeze the thawed spinach to remove as much excess water as possible (squeeze it in your fist), then add it to the ricotta sauce. Stir until the spinach is distributed throughout the sauce. Taste and adjust salt or pepper if needed. Turn the heat off.
step 4:
Add the cooked and drained pasta to the sauce and toss to coat. If the sauce becomes to thick or dry, add a small amount of the reserved pasta cooking water. Serve warm.

ingredients:
	name: all-purpose flour
	amount: 1/2
	unit: cup
	name: whole wheat flour
	amount: 1/2
	unit: cup
	name: salt

	name: butter, melted
	amount: 3
	unit: Tbsp
	name: vegetable oil for cooking
	amount: 1
	unit: tsp (or less)
step 0:
In a medium bowl, mix together the all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, and salt. In a separate large bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, and water until smooth. Add the flour mixture and melted butter to the whisked milk and eggs, then whisk again until no lumps remain.
step 1:
Cover the batter and refrigerate for 30 minutes or up to two days.
step 2:
When you're ready to make the crepes, lightly oil an 8" to 10" non-stick skillet. Pre-heat the skillet over medium flame. When the skillet is fully heated, scoop about 1/3 cup of the batter into the center of the skillet. Immediately lift the skillet and tilt it in a circular motion to allow the batter to run in a circular pattern and fill the bottom of the skillet. This is a quick motion and the batter should run and spread readily to a very thin layer on the surface of the skillet. If the batter is too thick to easily run and spread, whisk in a couple tablespoons of water and try again. If the skillet is too hot and the batter solidifies too fast, try lowering the heat a bit.
step 3:
Once the batter has spread over the surface of the skillet, return the skillet to the burner and cook until golden brown on the bottom. Flip and cook until golden brown on the second side. Remove the cooked crepe to a plate and start on the next one. Continue until all the batter has been used (6 to 8 8" crepes).

ingredients:
	name: frozen peas 
	amount: 1
	unit: lb.
	name: fresh lemon 
	amount: 1
	unit: n/a
	name: small shallot, minced (about 2 Tbsp)
	amount: 1
	unit: n/a
	name: olive oil 
	amount: 2

	name: Freshly cracked pepper 
	amount: n/a
	unit: n/a
	name: sprigs fresh mint 
	amount: 3-4
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Let the peas thaw in a colander to allow excess moisture to drain away. Rinsing briefly with cool water will expedite the thawing process.
step 1:
While the peas are thawing, prepare the lemon and shallot vinaigrette. Zest the lemon using a zester or a small holed cheese grater. Be sure to scrape off just the yellow zest and none of the bitter white pith. Set the zest aside, then squeeze about 2 tablespoons of the juice into a separate bowl.
step 2:
Peel the dry, papery skin from the shallot, then mince it finely. Add it to the bowl with the lemon juice, along with 2 Tbsp olive oil, 1/4 tsp salt, and some freshly cracked pepper (5-10 cranks of a pepper mill). Whisk the ingredients together until combined, then set aside.
step 3:
Rinse the mint to remove any dirt or debris. Pull the leaves from the stems and then slice into thin strips (or chop roughly).
step 4:
Add the thawed peas to a large bowl along with the vinaigrette, mint, and a hefty pinch of the lemon zest. Stir to combine, then taste and add more zest if desired. Serve immediately, or refrigerate to allow the flavors to blend.

	unit: n/a
	name: bunch fresh cilantro (optional)
	amount: 1/2
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Wash the potatoes well, then cut into 3/4-inch cubes. Place the cubed potatoes in a large pot and cover with water. Cover the pot with a lid and bring it up to a boil over high heat. Boil the potatoes for 5-6 minutes, or until they're tender when pierced with a fork. Drain the cooked potatoes in a colander.
step 1:
While the potatoes are boiling, begin the sauce. Peel the ginger with a vegetable peeler or scrape the skin off with the side of a spoon. Use a small holed cheese grater to grate about one inch of ginger (less if you prefer a more subtle ginger flavor). Mince the garlic.
step 2:
Add the ginger, garlic, and olive oil to a large, deep skillet (or a wide based pot). Sauté the ginger and garlic over medium low heat for 1-2 minutes, or just until soft and fragrant. Add the curry powder to the skillet and sauté for about a minute more to toast the spices.
step 3:
Add the tomato sauce to the skillet and stir to combine. Turn the heat up to medium and heat the sauce through. Taste the sauce and add salt, if needed. Add the cooked and drained potatoes to the skillet and stir to coat in the sauce. Add a couple tablespoons of water if the mixture seems dry or pasty.
step 4:
Create four small wells or dips in the potato mixture and crack an egg into each. Place a lid on the skillet and let it come up to a simmer. Simmer the eggs in the sauce for 6-10 minutes, or until cooked through (less time if runny yolks are desired). Top with chopped fresh cilantro.

step 4:
While the cakes are baking, place the cream cheese, butter, and vanilla extract in a bowl and allow them to come to room temperature. Once room temperature and soft, whisk with a fork until smooth. Stir in the powdered sugar a little at a time until it is all incorporated.
step 5:
Allow the cakes to cool before spreading the cream cheese frosting over top (otherwise it will melt and slide off). Enjoy!

	unit: cup
	name: (packed) fresh spinach
	amount: 2
	unit: cups
	name: crumbled feta
	amount: 2
	unit: oz
step 0:
Wash the potatoes well, then prick the skin several times with a fork. Place the potatoes on a microwave safe plate and microwave on high for 5 minutes. Pierce the potatoes in the center with a fork to test for doneness. If they still feel crunchy in the center, microwave longer, one minute at a time, until they are tender in the middle (mine took about 8 minutes).
step 1:
Let the potatoes cool for just a few minutes. Slice the potatoes into several pieces to make them easier to mash, then transfer to a large bowl. Add the butter, garlic powder, salt, some freshly cracked pepper, and milk. Mash the potatoes until the butter is melted and the seasonings are evenly distributed.
step 2:
Add the fresh spinach and stir it into the potatoes. Allow the residual heat of the potatoes to partially wilt the spinach. Leaving the spinach only partially wilted gives the potatoes more texture and volume.
step 3:
Finally, crumble the feta cheese over top and fold it into the potatoes. Taste the potatoes and adjust the salt, pepper, or butter if needed.

	name: brown sugar
	amount: 2
	unit: Tbsp
	name: apple cider vinegar
	amount: 2
	unit: Tbsp
step 0:
Dice the onion and mince the garlic. Sauté both in a large skillet with 1 Tbsp olive oil over medium heat until soft and transparent. Peel the carrots, then use a large holed cheese grater to shred them into the skillet. Cut the ends off the zucchini and shred it into the skillet as well. Continue to sauté over medium heat.
step 1:
While the onion, garlic, carrots, and zucchini are sautéing, roughly chop the mushrooms. Add the mushrooms to the skillet and season with 3/4 tsp salt and a generous dose of freshly cracked pepper. Continue to sauté the vegetables over medium heat until they release all of their moisture and it has evaporated from the bottom of the skillet (there should be no juices pooling on the bottom of the skillet).
step 2:
After the vegetables have sautéed and are mostly dry, transfer them to a bowl and let them cool for 5-10 minutes. Begin to preheat the oven to 375 degrees and coat the wells of a muffin tin with non-stick spray.
step 3:
Once the vegetables have cooled some, add the Worcestershire sauce, ketchup, egg, and breadcrumbs to the bowl. Mix these ingredients well until they are evenly combined. Add the ground turkey and use your hands to gently mix it into the vegetable mixture. Try to avoid over mixing.
step 4:
Evenly divide the meat mixture between the 12 cups of a muffin tin. Bake the mini loaves in the preheated 375 degree oven for 30 minutes.
step 5:
While the loaves are baking, mix the tomato glaze. Combine the ketchup, brown sugar, and apple cider vinegar in a small bowl and stir until smooth. Once the loaves have baked for 15 minutes, spoon the glaze over the muffins and let them bake with the glaze for the remaining 15 minutes.
step 6:
Allow the loaves to rest for 5 to 10 minutes before carefully running a knife around their outer edges and lifting out of the tin with a fork. The rest time will help solidify the loaves and keep them in one piece.

step 1:
Wash the potatoes well to remove any dirt or dust. Cut the potatoes into very thin, 1/4 inch matchsticks, then divide them between the two baking sheets.
step 2:
Drizzle each sheet of potatoes with 1 Tbsp olive oil, then toss the fries to coat. Sprinkle the fries with garlic powder, smoked paprika, salt, and freshly ground pepper. Don't worry, they'll get tossed with the spices when they get stirred during the baking process.
step 3:
Bake the fries in the fully preheated 400 degree oven, stirring gently with a spatula every 15 minutes. Bake until the fries are brown and crispy, but still slightly moist in the center. The fries will bake at different rates, depending on how thinly they are sliced, so keep a close eye. My batch took approximately 45 minutes to bake.

step 0:
Take the chops out of the refrigerator and let them warm on the countertop for about 10 minutes. Remove them from the package, pat dry with a paper towel, then season both sides of each chop with a pinch of salt and pepper.
step 1:
Heat 1 Tbsp of olive oil in a large skillet over medium to medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot (it should appear wavy on the surface, but not be smoking), add the chops. Let the pork chops cook until browned on each side (3-5 minutes per side), then transfer them to a clean plate. Remove the skillet from the heat.
step 2:
Let the skillet cool for just a couple of minutes, then add the blackberry jam, butter, balsamic vinegar, water, and sage. Return the skillet to the burner and turn the heat on to low. Whisk the ingredients together until the jam and the browned bits on the bottom of the skillet have dissolved into the sauce. Turn the heat up to medium and let the sauce come to a simmer. Let the sauce simmer over medium heat until it's thick enough to coat a spoon (5 minutes or so). Turn the heat off, taste the sauce, and add salt as needed (I added 1/8 tsp).
step 3:
Return the chops and any juices that have accumulated on the plate to the sauce. Coat each side of the chops in the sauce and let them warm through in the simmering sauce. Spoon the sauce over each chop after plating.

	amount: n/a
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Place the uncooked eggs in the bottom of a sauce pot so they are laying in a single layer. Add enough cool water to cover the eggs by one inch. Bring the pot up to a boil over high heat without a lid (about 10 minutes). As soon as it reaches a full, rolling boil, turn the heat off and place a lid on top. Let the eggs sit in the hot water bath with the lid in place for 15 minutes.
step 1:
After 15 minutes pour out the hot water and run cool water over top. If you live in an area that has warmish tap water, add ice to the pot to help cool the eggs down. Cooling the eggs down quickly stops the cooking process and prevents the yolks from turning green or greyish-green.
step 2:
After the eggs have cooled significantly (it's okay if they're a tad warm), carefully peel away the shells. Cut each egg in half, then scoop the cooked yolks into a bowl.
step 3:
Add the mayonnaise, Sriracha, garlic powder, smoked paprika, and a pinch of salt to the bowl with the yolks. Mash the ingredients together until it forms a fairly smooth paste. Taste and adjust the salt if needed.
step 4:
Spoon or pipe the Sriracha-yolk paste back into the egg whites where the yolks once sat. Garnish with a drizzle of Sriracha if desired. Serve immediately or refrigerate until ready to serve.

step 3:
While the kale is simmering, bring a medium pot of water to a boil, add the pasta, and cook until al dente (7-10 minutes). Drain the pasta and let it cool slightly, or until it looks a little dry and tacky in texture.
step 4:
Remove the pot with the kale and mushrooms from the heat. Add the pasta and stir to combine. The pot should be warm, but not steaming hot. If it's still steaming, let it cool for about 5 minutes.* Once slightly cooled, add 1/2 tsp salt, about 20 cranks of a pepper mill (or more if desired), and the grated Parmesan. Stir until all the pasta and vegetables are coated in Parmesan and pepper. Taste the pasta and add more salt or pepper if needed.

	unit: n/a
step 0:
Roughly chop the broccoli florets into smaller, bite-sized pieces. Combine the broccoli, about 3/4 of the shredded cheddar, and the pre-cooked rice in a large bowl. stir until they are evenly mixed. Save the remaining cheddar for sprinkling over the top of the casserole.
step 1:
Begin to preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Finely dice the onion and mince the garlic.
step 2:
Add the butter, onion, and garlic to a small sauce pot and cook over medium-low heat until the onions are soft and transparent (2-3 minutes). Add the flour and stir until a paste forms. Continue to stir and cook the paste for about two minutes, or just until it turns a light golden brown.
step 3:
Whisk the milk into the butter and flour mixture. Turn the heat up to medium. Continue to whisk the mixture as it heats, allowing it to reach a simmer, at which point it will thicken. Remove the sauce from the heat.
step 4:
Season the sauce with the salt, smoked paprika, cayenne, and about ten cranks of a pepper mill. Taste the sauce and add more seasoning if desired. The sauce should be heavily seasoned because it will be spread out over the broccoli and rice, which contain no seasoning of their own. Make it just a bit saltier than you'd prefer if eating the sauce on its own.
step 5:
Pour the sauce over the rice, broccoli, and cheese, and stir until everything is evenly coated in sauce. Coat an 8x8 or 9x9 casserole dish with non-stick spray, then spread the casserole mixture evenly in the dish. Top with the remaining shredded cheddar.
step 6:
Bake the casserole for 35-40 minutes, or until you get some light browning around the edges and on top. Divide into six portions and serve.

	name: warm water
	amount: 1
	unit: cup
	name: cornmeal
	amount: 2
	unit: Tbsp
step 0:
In a large bowl, combine 1 cup of the flour with the yeast, sugar, and salt. Add one cup of warm water and mix with a hand mixer on medium speed for three minutes. Use a timer to make sure it is mixed for a full three minutes.
step 1:
Begin to add the remaining 1 1/4 cups of flour, a small amount at a time, until you can no longer use the mixer. At that point, use a large wooden spoon to stir the rest of the flour into the dough. The amount of flour needed may be slightly more or less depending on the moisture content of your flour, but you should aim for a very soft, pliable, slightly sticky dough in the end.
step 2:
Coat a loaf pan with non-stick spray, then dust the inside heavily with cornmeal (about 2 Tbsp). Sprinkle a little extra flour onto the dough to keep it from sticking to your hands and mold it into a rough loaf shape. Place the loaf in the pan, cover with a damp paper towel, and let rise for one hour, or until the loaf has risen higher than the top of the loaf pan.
step 3:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Bake the risen loaf for 30-45 minutes, or until it sounds hollow when tapped. If the top begins to brown too much before 30 minutes, cover with foil to reduce further browning (I covered mine after 20 minutes).
step 4:
Remove the loaf from the pan and let it cool completely before slicing.

	name: feta cheese 
	amount: 2
	unit: oz.
step 0:
To make the dough, begin the night before. In a large bowl, stir together the flour, salt, and yeast until evenly combined. Add water, starting with just 3/4 cup, and stir until a sticky, shaggy ball of dough forms. The total amount of water needed will depend on the moisture level in your flour. Loosely cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it sit at room temperature for 12-24 hours.
step 1:
The next day, begin by preparing the caramelized onions. Thinly slice three onions and place them in a large skillet with 2 tablespoons of butter. Cook the onions and butter over low heat, stirring occasionally, for an hour, or until they are very soft and deep golden brown in color.
step 2:
To make the flatbread, preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Cover a baking sheet with foil, then spread 1 Tablespoon of olive oil over the surface. Sprinkle the fermented dough with flour to prevent it from sticking to your hands, scrape it out of the bowl onto a floured surface, and flatten it into a disc. Continue to stretch and press the dough until it is a large rectangle, approximately 1/4 inch thick. It can be transferred onto the prepared baking sheet for easier stretching and pulling toward the end.
step 3:
Spread the second tablespoon of olive oil over the surface of the dough, then sprinkle with 1/2 Tablespoon of Italian seasoning blend. Thaw the spinach in the microwave (about one minute on high), then squeeze out as much moisture as possible. Chop the artichoke hearts into bite-sized pieces.
step 4:
Top the flatbread with the caramelized onions, spinach, chopped artichoke hearts, and crumbled feta. Bake for 18-20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the edges of the crust are golden brown. Slice into 8-12 pieces and serve.

	amount: 2-3
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Line a baking sheet with foil. Wash the potatoes well, then dry with a paper towel. Coat each potato in vegetable oil, then prick the skin a few times with a fork. Place the potatoes on the baking sheet and transfer into the oven. Bake for 45 minute to an hour, or until soft all the way through.
step 1:
While the potatoes are baking, prepare the toppings. Prepare the enchilada sauce according to this recipe, then set aside. Slice the green onions and jalapeño, shred the cheese, rinse and drain the black beans, and allow the corn to thaw.
step 2:
Once the potatoes are cooked through, remove them from the oven (but leave it on, the potatoes will go back in). Cut each one lengthwise down the center, then once across. Open the potatoes up and mash the insides slightly.
step 3:
Drizzle a couple tablespoons of enchilada sauce over each potato, then top with black beans, corn, jalapeños, and a handful of cheddar cheese. Transfer the potatoes back into the oven for 3-5 minutes, or until the cheese has melted. Remove the potatoes from the oven, drizzle with more sauce if desired, then sprinkle with sliced green onions.

step 0:
In a small bowl, whisk together the room temperature butter and 3 Tbsp granulated sugar. Add the egg yolk and vanilla extract, then whisk again until smooth.
step 1:
Add the flour, salt, and baking powder to the bowl. Stir the ingredients until everything is evenly mixed. Place the cookie dough in the refrigerator for about 15 minutes to chill the dough and make it a little more stiff. Begin to preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
step 2:
While the dough is chilling, stir together the sugar and cinnamon for the cookie topping in a small bowl. Cover a baking sheet with parchment paper (or foil, but be aware that foil will make the cookies brown more on the bottom).
step 3:
Remove the dough from the refrigerator and divide it into two pieces. Roll each piece of dough into a large ball. Roll each ball in the cinnamon-sugar topping until heavily coated. Place the unbaked cookies at least six inches apart on the baking sheet.
step 4:
Bake the cookies for 16-18 minutes, or until browned around the edges and slightly golden in the middle. Allow the cookies to cool on a wire rack before eating (they will be soft just after baking, but will firm up upon cooling).

	amount: 1/4
	unit: lb.
step 0:
Take the broccoli out of the freezer and let it begin to thaw. Dice the onion and mince the garlic. Begin to sauté the onion and garlic in a large pot with butter over medium-low heat.
step 1:
While the onion and garlic are cooking, peel and cut the carrots into half rounds. Add the carrots to the pot and continue to sauté. Dice the red pepper and add it to the pot. Finally, cut the squash into quarter rounds and add it to the pot as well. Continue to sauté the ingredients in the pot just until the squash begins to soften.
step 2:
Add the chicken broth to the pot and turn the heat up to medium. Cut the cream cheese into small pieces, and add it to the pot. Stir and cook the vegetables, broth, and cream cheese until the cream cheese is melted in and the sauce is smooth. Let the sauce come up to a simmer.
step 3:
Add the frozen tortellini directly to the pot (frozen tortellini is precooked and only needs to be heated through). Let the sauce come back up to a simmer after adding the tortellini, then simmer until the tortellini is tender and heated through (about 5 minutes). The sauce should thicken some while simmering.
step 4:
While the tortellini is simmering, cut the broccoli florets into smaller pieces. Finally, season the tortellini and cream sauce with 1/4 cup grated parmesan, some freshly cracked pepper, about 1/4 tsp of salt, and a dash of hot sauce (if you like hot sauce). Stir the ingredients in, taste, and adjust the seasoning if needed. The Parmesan will further thicken the sauce as it melts in.
step 5:
Finally, to keep the broccoli vibrant green in color, add the florets to the pot and cook just long enough to heat through (3-5 minutes). Serve hot.

step 0:
Add the olive oil and sausage links to a large pot and cook over medium-low heat until golden brown on the outside and slightly firm (about 5 minutes). Remove the sausage to a cutting board and slice them into rounds. Return the sausage slices to the pot.
step 1:
Continue to sauté the sausage until fully browned. While the sausage is cooking, dice the onion and mince the garlic. Add the onions and garlic to the pot and continue to sauté until the onions are soft and transparent. The moisture from the onions should dissolve any browned bits of sausage from the bottom of the pot.
step 2:
Once the onions are soft, add the can of crushed tomatoes, dried basil, oregano, red pepper flakes, and a healthy dose of freshly cracked pepper (15-20 cranks of a pepper mill). Stir to combine.
step 3:
Empty the two cans of Great Northern beans into a colander and rinse with cool water. Let the excess water drain away, then add the beans to the pot along with the frozen chopped spinach (no need to thaw). Stir the contents of the pot and allow them to heat through, stirring occasionally
step 4:
(about 10 minutes). Taste and add salt if needed (1/4-1/2 tsp). If a thicker mixture is desired, let the pot simmer longer until the sauce has reduced. Serve hot with crusty bread for dipping.

	name: chopped walnuts
	amount: 1/4
	unit: cup
	name: crumbled feta
	amount: 1
	unit: oz
step 0:
Rinse the quinoa well with cool water to remove the saponins, a natural coating that can taste bitter. Remove the stems of the kale leaves by running a sharp knife along both sides of each stem. Cut each leaf in half lengthwise, then across into 1/2 inch strips. Rinse the kale well in a colander.
step 1:
Mince the garlic and add it to a large pot with the olive oil. Sauté over medium-low heat for one minute, or until the garlic is slightly softened. Add the rinsed kale and sauté for 2-3 minutes more, or just until the kale has wilted and looks dark green and glossy.
step 2:
Add the rinsed quinoa to the pot along with vegetable broth. Stir the contents of the pot, place a lid on top, and turn the heat up to medium-high. Let the pot come to a boil. As soon as it does, reduce the heat to low and let it simmer for 15 minutes. Make sure the pot is simmering the whole time.
step 3:
After 15 minutes, check the quinoa to see if it is done. Each granule should look slightly transparent with a white outer rim. If there is still a considerable amount of broth left in the bottom of the pot, replace the lid and let simmer for a few minutes more. If there is a small amount of liquid, simply remove the lid and sauté for a couple of minutes, or until the excess liquid evaporates.
step 4:
While the pot is simmering, zest half of the lemon. Chop the walnuts and crumble the feta.
step 5:
Once the quinoa is cooked and any excess moisture has evaporated, remove the pot from the heat. Sprinkle the lemon zest over the kale and quinoa. Squeeze the juice from half of the lemon over the pot as well. Finally, sprinkle the chopped nuts and crumbled feta on top and serve.**

Allow the pot to come back up to a boil, turn the heat down to medium-low, place a lid on top, and let it simmer for about 10 minutes. (the cranberries will burst as the cook, so don't forget the lid).
step 1:
Meanwhile, stir one envelope of plain gelatin into 3 tablespoons of water. Let the mixture sit until the gelatin has absorbed the water and formed a thick jelly-like texture (about 5 minutes).
step 2:
Once the cranberries have simmered for 10 minutes, stir in the softened gelatin, lemon juice, and cinnamon. Place the pot in the refrigerator to cool.
step 3:
While the cranberry mixture is cooling, finely dice the celery and apple. Stir together the celery, apple, and walnuts in a large bowl. When the cranberry mixture has cooled a little (it's okay if it's warm, just not piping hot), pour it into the bowl with the celery, apple, and walnuts. Stir to combine, then return to the refrigerator to cool completely (about 2 hours). Serve chilled.

	name: smoked provolone 
	amount: 3
	unit: slices
	name: crushed red pepper 
	amount: 1/2
	unit: tsp
step 0:
The night before, combine the flour, salt, and yeast in a large bowl. Add just enough water to form a shaggy, slightly sticky ball of dough, with no dry flour left on the bottom of the bowl. Loosely cover the dough and let it sit at room temperature for 12-18 hours.
step 1:
When you're ready to make the pizza, preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Cover a baking sheet with aluminum foil and lightly mist it with non-stick spray. Sprinkle the cornmeal over the prepared baking sheet.
step 2:
Sprinkle a little flour over the fermented dough and on a clean work surface. Scrape the soft dough out of the bowl and gently knead it just a few times. Flatten the dough, then transfer it to the prepared baking sheet. Drizzle one tablespoon of olive oil onto the surface of the dough, then use your hands to spread and stretch it to cover the surface of the baking sheet. It doesn't need to be perfect.
step 3:
After the dough is stretched, sprinkle the Italian seasoning over the surface. Thinly slice the red onion, salami, and provolone. Roughly chop the artichokes, if desired, or just break them up with your hands. Spread the onion, salami, provolone, and artichokes over the surface of the dough. Lastly, top with a generous sprinkle of crushed red pepper.
step 4:
Bake the flat bread in the fully preheated oven for 15-18 minutes, or until golden brown on the edges and the cheese is bubbled and browned. Cut into eight equal pieces and serve.

Once the yeast water is frothy, pour it into the bowl with the flour and salt. Stir the ingredients together until they form a shaggy ball of dough. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for 8 minutes, incorporating an additional 1/2 to 1 cup of flour as you knead.
step 2:
After the dough has been kneaded for 8 minutes, it should be smooth, elastic, and will spring back when poked with a finger. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover lightly, and let rise for one hour or until double in size.
step 3:
Once the dough is double in size, punch the dough down, turn it out onto a clean surface, and flatten it into a disc. Cut the disc into 16 equal sized wedges. One by one, roll each wedge into a long rope, about 1/2 in diameter (about 18 inches long). Cut the rope into one inch sections, and place them on a baking sheet that has been covered with parchment and lightly misted with non-stick spray (you'll need two sheets to fit all the pretzel bites).
step 4:
Let the pretzel bites rise for 30 minutes, or until soft and pillowy. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, carefully addd 1/4 cup of baking soda (it will fizz and bubble furiously for a moment, so be careful).
step 5:
Add 15-20 of the pretzel bites at a time to the boiling baking soda water and boil for about 90 seconds, or until puffed and a few begin to crack. Stir lightly as they boil to make sure all sides of the pretzel bites contact the boiling water. Remove the boiled pretzel bites with a slotted spoon and let drain on a wire cooling rack. Repeat in small batches until all of the pretzel bites are boiled.
step 6:
After the bites have drained for a few minutes, return them to the prepared baking sheets. Whisk together one egg with one tablespoon of water. Use a pastry brush to liberally brush the egg mixture over the boiled pretzel bites. If you want to make plain pretzel bites, sprinkle with coarse sea salt after brushing with the egg wash.
step 7:
Bake the pretzel bites for 15-17 minutes, or until deeply golden brown and shiny. Allow the pretzel bites to cool for a few minutes.
step 8:
In a small bowl, stir together the Parmesan, garlic powder, salt, and some freshly cracked pepper. In a separate small bowl, melt the butter in the microwave (microwave for 20 seconds, then stir until completely melted).
step 9:
Place the baked pretzel bites in a large bowl and pour the melted butter over top. Toss to coat. Add the parmesan topping and toss to coat again. Serve immediately.

prep_time: 10
cook_time: 20
num_servings: 4
ingredients:
	name: bacon (1/2 12 oz. pkg)
	amount: 6
	unit: oz
	name: small onion
	amount: 1
	unit: n/a
	name: chicken broth
	amount: 2
	unit: cups
	name: pasta
	amount: 1/2
	unit: lb
	name: 3-4 cups fresh spinach
	amount: 1/4
	unit: lb
	name: grated Parmesan
	amount: 1/3
	unit: cup
step 0:
Cut the bacon across the strips into one-inch pieces. Sauté the bacon in a large skillet until it is brown and crispy (no extra fat needed). Remove the browned bacon to a bowl with a slotted spoon. Carefully pour the fat off into a separate bowl, leaving about one tablespoon in the skillet.
step 1:
While the bacon cooks, dice the onion. Once the bacon is removed and the fat is drained from the skillet, add the diced onions and sauté until they are soft and transparent. Allow the moisture from the onions to dissolve some of the browned bits off of the bottom of the skillet.
step 2:
Add two cups of chicken broth to the skillet and dissolve off any remaining browned bits of bacon drippings from the bottom of the skillet.
step 3:
Finally, add the uncooked pasta to the skillet, place a lid on top, and let the skillet come to a boil over high heat. Once it reaches a boil, give it a quick stir, turn the heat down to low, and let simmer for 10 minutes with the lid in place. Give the skillet a stir to loosen the pasta from the bottom every few minutes or so, replacing the lid quickly each time. After 10 minutes the pasta should be tender and most of the broth absorbed. There should be a little bit of thick, saucy broth remaining in the bottom of the skillet.
step 4:
Add the fresh spinach to the skillet and stir until it has wilted into the pasta. Turn off the heat, add the cooked bacon back to the skillet, sprinkle the Parmesan over top, stir to combine, and then serve.

step 0:
To make the spice rub, combine the garlic, ginger, vegetable oil, sesame oil, soy sauce, brown sugar, and 5 spice powder in a small bowl. Stir until combined. (Grate the ginger using a small holed cheese grater, or mince with a knife.)
step 1:
Rub the spice mixture all over the chicken pieces, getting between the skin and meat whenever possible.
step 2:
Dice the onion and place it in the bottom of the slow cooker. Pour the rice wine over the onion, then layer in the chicken pieces. Make sure the chicken pieces are closely packed in the cooker. Cover the slow cooker and cook on high for four hours.
step 3:
After four hours, the chicken will be very soft and tender. Use tongs to carefully remove the chicken from the liquid in the slow cooker and place them on a baking sheet. Adjust your oven rack so that the top of the chicken will be 5 inches from the broiler (the broiler's heat element is usually on the roof of your oven). Broil the chicken on high for 5 minutes, or until the skin is brown and crispy. Keep a close eye on the chicken while it's under the broiler because every broiler is slightly different and it can burn quickly.

	name: Optional toppings: cilantro, avocado, shredded cheddar, sour cream, crispy tortilla strips, fresh lime
	amount: n/a
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Dice the onion and mince the garlic. Sauté both in a large pot with the vegetable oil over medium heat for 3-5 minutes, or until transparent.
step 1:
Add the chile powder, cumin, and cayenne to the pot. Continue to sauté for one minute to toast the spices. Add the masa harina or cornmeal and continue to sauté for 2-3 minutes to toast the starch. The corn will stick to the bottom of the pot as you sauté, so turn the heat down slightly if needed to prevent it from burning.
step 2:
Whisk the vegetable broth into the corn mixture and allow it to come up to a simmer. The liquid will begin to thicken slightly when it starts to simmer. Add the tomato paste and stir until it dissolves in.
step 3:
Add the can of diced tomatoes (with juices), black beans (drained and rinsed), and frozen corn kernels. Peel and cut the sweet potato into 1/2 inch cubes, then add it to the pot.
step 4:
Cover the pot and allow the soup to come up to a simmer over medium heat. Once it begins to simmer, turn the heat down to low and let simmer for 30 minutes, or until the sweet potatoes have softened. Stir the soup occasionally as it simmers to keep the corn from sticking to the bottom of the pot. Taste the soup and adjust the salt if needed (this will depend on the brand of broth you use and the canned goods).

	unit: cup
step 0:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. In a large bowl, stir together the powdered sugar, cocoa powder, cornstarch, salt, and cayenne pepper until evenly combined.
step 1:
Add the egg whites, whole egg, and vanilla extract to the powdered sugar mixture. Carefully stir the mixture until all of the powdered sugar has dissolved into the eggs and a very thick batter forms. It may seem like there is not enough moisture to stir in all the powdered sugar, but keep stirring and it will eventually melt in. The mixture will be very thick and stiff, so use a strong spoon. Add the chocolate chips and stir until incorporated.
step 2:
Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Spoon the batter, one heaping tablespoon at a time, onto the baking sheets. Be sure to leave a couple inches between each cookie because they will spread. (I suggest ten cookies per sheet.)
step 3:
Bake one cookie sheet at a time for 14 minutes or until the cookies are puffed and cracked over the surface. Allow the cookies to cool before removing from the parchment.

step 0:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Chop the eggplant into small cubes (1/2-3/4 inch), cut the carrots into matchsticks, slice the onion, cut the squash into quarter rounds, and cut the broccoli into small florets.
step 1:
Divide the chopped vegetables between to baking sheets covered in foil. Drizzle each sheet with 1 Tbsp olive oil, 1/4 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp dried oregano, and a generous amount of freshly cracked pepper. Toss the vegetables on the baking sheet until they are all lightly coated in oil and spices (the more you toss, the more the oil will spread over the surface of all the vegetables). Roast the vegetables in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until they are soft and slightly charred on the edges. Stir once, half way through roasting.
step 2:
While the vegetables are roasting, cook the pasta according to the package directions (boil for 7-10 minutes, or until al dente). Once cooked, drain the pasta and return it to the pot with the burner turned off. Add the sauce and toss to coat.
step 3:
In a medium bowl, stir together the ricotta, the egg, one cup of the shredded mozzarella, 1/4 tsp salt, and a generous amount of freshly cracked pepper. Stir until smooth and even.
step 4:
Coat an 8x8 inch casserole dish with non-stick spray. Spread 1/3 of the pasta and marinara sauce over the bottom. Layer 1/2 of the ricotta mixture over the pasta, then 1/2 of the roasted vegetables. Repeat these three layers, then end with one final layer of pasta and sauce, and the final cup of shredded mozzarella.
step 5:
Reduce the heat in the oven to 375 degrees and bake the casserole for 30 minutes, or until heated through and the cheese on top is melted and slightly browned on the edges.

	amount: 2
	unit: oz
step 0:
Cook the pasta according to the package directions (boil for 7-10 minutes, or until al dente). Drain the pasta in a colander.
step 1:
While the pasta is cooking, add the sausage links to a large pot along with one tablespoon of olive oil. Cook the sausage over medium heat for about five minutes, or until they are slightly browned and firm enough to slice.
step 2:
While the sausage is cooking, mince the garlic and dice the onion. Remove the sausage from the pot and add the onion and garlic in its place. Sauté the onion and garlic in the pot for 2-3 minutes, allowing the moisture to dissolve the brown bits from the bottom of the pot. Meanwhile, slice the sausage into medallions. Once the onions are soft and transparent, add the sliced sausage back to the pot and cook for about 5 minutes more, or until the sausage is cooked through.
step 3:
Add the can of crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, basil, salt, pepper, and brown sugar to the pot. Stir until the tomato paste is evenly combined with the tomato sauce.
step 4:
By this time the pasta should be fully cooked and drained. Add the drained pasta to the pot, along with the frozen broccoli and spinach. Stir to combine. Heat the pasta and sauce over a medium flame until warmed through (stir occasionally to help it heat evenly). Crumble the feta into the pot, stir to combine, then serve.

step 0:
Thoroughly wash the potatoes then cut them into 1-1.5 inch cubes. Place the cubed potatoes in a pot, cover with water, then bring them up to a boil. Boil the potatoes for 7-10 minutes, or until they are very tender and fall apart when pierced with a fork. Drain the potatoes in a colander.
step 1:
Meanwhile, slice the green onions and dice the celery into very small pieces. Pull the parsley leaves from the stems and give them a rough chop. Peel and chop the hard boiled eggs. Place the onions, celery, parsley, and eggs in a large bowl.
step 2:
To make the dressing, stir together the mayonnaise, mustard, vinegar, blackened seasoning, and salt.
step 3:
Once the potatoes are well drained and slightly cooled, add them to the bowl with the onion, celery, parsley, and egg. Pour the dressing over top and stir the ingredients until well combined. Slightly mash the potatoes as you stir until the salad is to your desired consistency (I prefer mine chunky). Serve immediately or refrigerate until ready to eat.

	amount: 1
	unit: tsp
step 0:
Mince the garlic and dice the onion and bell peppers. In a heavy skillet, sauté the garlic and onion in olive oil over medium heat until soft and transparent (2-3 minutes). Add the ground beef and cook until fully brown (5 minutes). Lastly, add the diced bell pepper to the skillet and continue to sauté until they are slightly soft (3-5 minutes).
step 1:
Add the diced tomatoes and their juices to the skillet along with the uncooked rice, basil, oregano, and some freshly cracked pepper (10-15 cranks of a pepper mill). Stir the ingredients in the skillet well.
step 2:
Add 1.5 cups of beef broth to the skillet and stir to combine. Place the lid on the skillet, turn the heat up to high, and allow the mixture to come up to a full boil. Once it reaches a boil, turn the heat down to low and let it simmer for 30 minutes. You should be able to hear the liquid simmering quietly the whole time. If you can't, turn the heat up just slightly until it begins to simmer.
step 3:
After 30 minutes, remove the lid, and check to see if the rice is tender and most of the liquid has been absorbed. If the rice is still a bit crunchy, return the lid and allow it to continue to cook for 10 minutes more.
step 4:
Once the rice is tender, fluff the mixture with a fork. In a separate bowl, combine the tomato sauce and worcestershire sauce. Pour the tomato sauce over the skillet and serve.

	amount: n/a
	unit: n/a
step 0:
The day before, combine the flour, salt, and yeast in a bowl. Stir until they're very well combined. Add 1 Tbsp of olive oil and 3/4 cups water. Stir until the dough forms a ball. If there is still dry flour on the bottom of the bowl or the dough doesn't form a single, cohesive ball of dough, add more water, 1 Tbsp at a time until the dough comes together. The dough should be slightly sticky and shaggy in appearance.
step 1:
Loosely cover the dough in the bowl and allow it to ferment for 12-16 hours at room temperature. This develops the gluten, making kneading unnecessary.
step 2:
When it's time to make the pizza, begin preheating the oven to 450 degrees. Oil a cast iron skillet with another tablespoon of olive oil. Use the excess oil from the skillet (there will be a lot) to oil your hands and the dough in the bowl. Pull the dough out of the bowl and place it in the oiled skillet. Press it down into the skillet until it covers the entire bottom of the skillet (it will be very loose and soft).
step 3:
Top the pizza with sauce, cheese, and your desired toppings. Cover the pizza edge to edge with the sauce, cheese, and toppings. The dough will be very thick, so there is no need for a dry edge or crust around the outside.
step 4:
Bake the pizza in the fully preheated oven for 18-22 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly.

Once the beans are very soft, use an immersion blender** to blend the soup until it is thick and creamy (leave some beans whole if desired). Taste the soup and add salt if needed (this will depend on the brand of vegetable broth used).

step 0:
Season the chicken breast liberally with salt and pepper. Cook the chicken in a countertop grill, or in a skillet until cooked through. Let the chicken cool completely, then chop into small pieces.
step 1:
While the chicken is cooling, dice the celery into small pieces. The easiest way to do this is to cut each stalk into strips lengthwise, then cut across the strips into small cubes.
step 2:
Prepare the dressing my mixing the mayonnaise, cider vinegar, honey, Dijon mustard, 1/4 tsp salt, and some freshly cracked pepper.
step 3:
Tear the kale into small, bite-sized pieces, rinse, and then dry the leaves well. (Rinsed kale can be rolled up in a clean, dry dish towel to help absorb excess water). Place the kale in a bowl, then layer the chopped chicken, diced celery, sliced almonds, and golden raisins over top. Add the dressing and stir very well, or until everything is well coated in the dressing. Serve immediately.

	name: fresh cilantro (optional)
	amount: 1/4
	unit: bunch
step 0:
Dice the onion and mince the garlic so they are ready to go when needed.
step 1:
Add the vegetable oil to a large soup pot. Break the vermicelli noodles into one to two inch sections and then add them to the pot. Cook the dry noodles in the oil over medium-low heat while constantly stirring for 3-5 minutes, or until the noodles have turned golden brown and are slightly blistered.
step 2:
Add the diced onion, minced garlic, and cumin to the pot with the noodles and continue to cook and stir for a few minutes more, or until the onions have softened.
step 3:
Add a little of the juice from the can of tomatoes to the pot to stop the browning of the noodles. Use a blender or immersion blender to purée the canned tomatoes along with their remaining juices. Add the puréed tomatoes to the pot with the noodles, along with the six cups of chicken broth.
step 4:
If using a jalapeño pepper, add it to the pot whole (this gives a slight jalapeño flavor without too much heat). Place a lid on the pot, turn the heat up to medium high, and allow it to come to a boil. Let the pot simmer for about 15 minutes, or until the noodles are soft.
step 5:
Add lime juice and roughly chopped cilantro leaves to the finished soup just before serving (I used juice from half the lime, but adjust to your liking).

	unit: n/a
step 0:
Peel and dice the sweet potato into 1/2 to 3/4 inch cubes (size matters, make them small). Sauté the sweet potato cubes in a large skillet with olive oil over medium heat for about 5 minutes, or until the sweet potatoes have softened about half way through (they'll cook more later).
step 1:
Add the chorizo to the skillet (squeeze it out of its casing if it came in links) with the sweet potatoes. Sauté the chorizo and sweet potatoes together, breaking the chorizo up into small pieces as it browns.
step 2:
Once the chorizo is fully browned, pour off any excess grease if needed. Rinse and drain the black beans. Add the beans, salsa, and uncooked rice to the skillet. Stir them into the sweet potatoes and chorizo until everything is well combined.
step 3:
Add the chicken broth, stir briefly, then place a lid on the skillet. Allow the contents of the skillet to come up to a boil, then turn the heat down to low. Let the skillet simmer on low for 30 minutes. Make sure it is simmering the whole time (you should be able to hear it quietly simmer away). If it is not, turn the heat up slightly.
step 4:
After 30 minutes the rice should be tender and have absorbed all of the liquid. Turn off the heat, fluff the mixture, sprinkle the cheese on top, then return the lid to trap the residual heat and help the cheese melt. Slice the green onions while the cheese is melting, then sprinkle them on top and serve.

step 0:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Drain the pineapple juice from the can to use in the sauce (it should be about 3/4 cup juice total). Save the pineapple chunks for later. Combine the pineapple juice, grated ginger, minced garlic, soy sauce, rice vinegar, brown sugar, and cornstarch in a small sauce pot. Stir until everything is well combined and the cornstarch is dissolved. Cook the mixture over medium heat until it begins to boil and becomes thick and glossy. Turn the burner off and add the pineapple chunks to the sauce.
step 1:
Coat a small casserole dish with non-stick spray. Arrange the chicken thighs in the dish so that they are not overlapping. Pour the pineapple teriyaki sauce over the chicken, allowing some to get under the chicken pieces.
step 2:
Bake the chicken in the preheated oven for 35 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through. Top the chicken with the sliced green onions. To serve, scoop one chicken thigh plus pineapple pieces and sauce over a bowl of cooked rice.

Crack the eggs on top of the spinach and tomatoes. Drizzle the cream over everything in the dish, then top with the shredded cheese. Bake the dish in the oven for 15-20 minutes, or until the whites are opaque, but still soft and moist (they should jiggle slightly when you shake the dish). The exact cooking time will depend on the size and shape of your dish, so begin checking for doneness at around 15 minutes.

	unit: cup
step 0:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Spread 1/2 cup of marinara sauce over the bottom of a deep pie dish or a rectangular casserole dish. Thinly slice the onion and sprinkle the slices over the marinara.
step 1:
Thinly slice the eggplant, zucchini, yellow squash, and tomatoes (about 1/4 inch thick). The vegetables are easiest to layer when they are the same diameter, so if one of your vegetables is much bigger around than the others, slice the rounds in half or into quarters to make it more similar in size. Layer the vegetables in the casserole dish like dominos. Fit as many of the vegetable slices in as possible.
step 2:
Season the top of the layered vegetables lightly with salt, pepper, dried basil, and oregano. Lastly, add the remaining 1/2 cup of marinara to the top of the vegetables (it doesn't have to be even).
step 3:
Cover the dish with foil and bake for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, remove the foil and add the shredded cheese to the top. Return the dish to the oven and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and lightly browned.

	name: dry roasted peanuts, unsalted
	amount: 1/3
	unit: cup
	name: cooked rice 
	amount: 4
	unit: cups
step 0:
Mix the ingredients for the sauce together in a bowl and set aside. Chop the red bell pepper into 1/2 inch pieces. Slice the green onions and roughly chop the peanuts.
step 1:
In a large bowl, whisk together the egg, 2 Tbsp of cornstarch, and a pinch of pepper until smooth. Cut the chicken breast into small, 1/2 inch cubes and toss to coat in the egg mixture.
step 2:
Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium high heat until it is very hot, but not smoking (the oil should look wavy on the surface). To test whether or not the oil is hot enough, drop a bit of the egg mixture into the skillet. It should poof up and bubble furiously. Once the oil is very hot, add the egg coated chicken. Spread it out in the skillet and let it cook until golden brown on the bottom. Once golden, break up the pieces and flip them over. Cook a few minutes longer, or until golden on all sides and cooked through. Remove the cooked chicken from the skillet.
step 3:
Add the frozen broccoli florets to the hot skillet and cook for just a few minutes, or until it is mostly warmed through. Add the chopped bell pepper and cook for one to two minutes more, or just until the raw edge has been taken off (it should still be fairly crisp).
step 4:
Finally, add the chicken back to the skillet, along with the prepared sauce. Stir the skillet until everything is coated in the sauce and the sauce has become thick and bubbly (the heat should remain on medium-high). Stir in the chopped peanuts and sprinkle the sliced green onions over top. Serve with rice.

step 0:
Add the olive oil and sausage links to a large pot and cook over medium heat until they are browned on the outside and firm enough to slice into rounds. Remove the sausage from the pot with tongs, slice into rounds, then return them to the pot and cook for a few minutes more, or until fully browned.
step 1:
While the sausage is cooking, slice or mince the garlic and slice or dice the onion (depending on how big you want your pieces). Slice the mushrooms.
step 2:
Once the sausage is browned, add the crushed tomatoes, onion, garlic, mushrooms, basil, and oregano to the pot. Stir to combine and to dissolve any browned bits off the bottom of the pot.
step 3:
Add the vegetable broth and pasta, then stir to combine. Place a lid on the pot, turn the heat up to high, and bring it to a rapid boil. As soon as it reaches a full boil, give it a stir, replace the lid, turn the heat down to low. Let the pot simmer on low for 15 minutes. Stir it every five minutes or so while it's simmering. Make sure it's simmering (bubbling) the whole time. If it is not, turn the heat up slightly.
step 4:
After 15 minutes of simmering, the pasta should be tender and most of the liquid should be absorbed. If there is still too much liquid, let it simmer without a lid for a couple more minutes. Stir in the parmesan and top with fresh chopped parsley, if desired.

step 0:
Begin by making the marshmallow cream. In a glass or metal bowl, whisk together the egg whites, granulated sugar, cream of tartar, and a pinch of salt until well combined. Place about 1 inch of water in a small sauce pot and bring it to a boil. Place the bowl with the egg white mixture over the boiling water and whisk by hand for 6 minutes. Remove the bowl from the heat, add the vanilla, and use a hand mixer or stand mixer to whip the egg white mixture to glossy peaks (about 5 minutes). Refrigerate until ready to use.
step 1:
Next, begin the macaron shells. Place the almonds, powdered sugar, and cocoa powder in a food processor. Process the mixture until it is a super fine powder. Sift the mixture through a wire sieve into a bowl.
step 2:
In a separate bowl (glass or metal) combine the egg whites, sugar, and cream of tartar. Stir or whisk together until combined, then use a hand mixer or stand mixer to whip the whites into stiff, glossy peaks (about 5 minutes).
step 3:
Fold about 1/3 of the cocoa almond mixture at a time into the whipped egg whites until no dry powder remains. After all of the dry mixture has been folded in, the mixture should have the consistency of thick, hot lava.
step 4:
Cover two baking sheets with parchment paper. Use a pastry bag to pipe the macaron mixture into 1.5 inch rounds on the parchment paper. Leave enough space for the macarons to spread slightly without touching. After piping all of the macarons onto the sheet, slam the baking sheet on a counter a few times to force any larger air bubbles to the surface. Let the cookies sit out at room temperature for about 30 minutes so that the surface dries slightly (this helps form a "foot" or ruffle on the bottom of the macaron).
step 5:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. After 30 minutes of sitting, the macarons should have a dull, less glossy appearance. Bake one sheet at a time for 13 minutes each. Allow the macarons to cool to room temperature before removing from the parchment.
step 6:
To make the ganache, break up the chocolate into small pieces and place in a microwave safe bowl. Add the heavy cream. Microwave on high for 15 seconds, then stir well. Microwave for 15 seconds once more, then stir until the chocolate is completely melted and has created a smooth mixture with the cream. Let cool.
step 7:
Fill a pastry bag with the marshmallow creme and a second bag with the chocolate ganache. Flip half of the macarons over and pipe a circle of marshmallow creme around the outside edge of the bottom. Fill the center of the marshmallow creme circle with ganache, then place a second macaron shell on top and press down slightly. Dip the filled macarons in the crushed graham crackers to make it stick to the marshmallow creme. Tip: Dip soon after filling as the marshmallow dries a bit and gets less tacky as it sits.

step 0:
Slice the jalapeño lengthwise and scrape out the seeds with a spoon. Cut off the stem and dice the remaining parts of the pepper. Mince the garlic. Sauté the jalapeño and garlic with vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat for one to two minutes, or until the garlic is soft.
step 1:
Add the ground beef to the skillet and continue to sauté until it is fully browned. Drain and rinse the black beans, then add them to the skillet along with the chili powder and salt. Stir to combine and heat through.
step 2:
Drain the pineapple chunks, then roughly chop them into smaller pieces (save the remaining half of the can for another use). Slice the green onions. Pull the cilantro leaves from the stems and give them a rough chop. Turn the heat under the skillet off, then stir in the pineapple, green onions, and cilantro.
step 3:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. To make the enchilada sauce, combine the vegetable oil, flour, and chili powder in a medium pot. Turn the heat on to medium and whisk the ingredients together. Once the mixture begins to bubble, continue to whisk and cook for one minute. Add the water, tomato paste, cumin, garlic powder, cayenne, cocoa, and salt. Whisk to combine and allow the mixture to come up to a simmer, at which point it will thicken. Turn the heat off.
step 4:
To make the enchiladas, warm the tortillas in the microwave, 4-6 at a time, covered with a damp paper towel. Fill each tortilla with about 3 tablespoons of the beef mixture, then roll it up. Place the filled and rolled enchiladas in a casserole dish, seam side down. Repeat until all of the filling is used (makes about 12 6-inch enchiladas, or 8 8-inch enchiladas).
step 5:
Pour the sauce over top and bake in the preheated 375 degree oven for 30 minutes, or until the edges of the tortillas are crispy and the sauce is bubbling.

	unit: lb.
	name: shredded gouda or smoked mozzarella
	amount: 1
	unit: cup
step 0:
Begin by making the vegetable mix. Dice the onion and mince the garlic. Sauté both in a large skillet with the olive oil over medium heat until soft. Add the frozen broccoli and cauliflower pieces and and the frozen spinach to the skillet. Continue to sauté until the frozen vegetables are warmed through.
step 1:
While the onions, garlic, frozen broccoli, and frozen spinach are cooking, peel and shred the carrots using a large hole cheese grater or box grater. Dice the zucchini into small pieces. Add the carrots and zucchini to the skillet and sauté for one to two minutes more. Season the skillet lightly with salt and pepper. Set the sautéed vegetables aside.
step 2:
Bring a large pot of water to a boil for the pasta. Cook the pasta according to the package directions (boil for 7-10 minutes, or until al dente). Drain the pasta in a colander.
step 3:
While the pasta is cooking, prepare the sauce. Add the butter and flour to a medium sauce pot. Melt the butter over medium heat and use a whisk to incorporate the flour as the butter melts. Allow the flour and butter mixture to begin to bubble. Continue to whisk and cook the mixture for two minutes. If it begins to brown, move on to the next step immediately.
step 4:
Whisk the milk into the butter and flour mixture. Also stir in the nutmeg, garlic powder, salt, and some freshly cracked pepper. Allow the milk to come up to a simmer over medium heat, making sure to whisk frequently to prevent scorching on the bottom. When the milk comes up to a simmer it will begin to thicken.
step 5:
When the sauce is thick enough to coat a spoon, turn the heat down to low and whisk in the parmesan until it is melted and the sauce is thick. Turn the heat off.
step 6:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Return the well drained pasta to the large pot with the heat turned off. Add the sautéed vegetables and the white sauce. Stir until everything is well combined and coated in the sauce. Pour the mixture into a casserole dish that has been coated with non-stick spray. Sprinkle the shredded gouda on top and bake in a preheated 375 degree oven for 30 minutes. Serve hot.

	amount: 1/2
	unit: tsp
	name: bunch green onions 
	amount: 1
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Cut the chicken thighs into small, one inch chunks. Add the vegetable oil to a large pot along with the chopped chicken thighs and chorizo (squeeze the chorizo out of the casing). Cook the meat over medium heat until the chorizo is browned and the chicken is white and firm (about 7-10 minutes). Drain off the excess fat. Add the frozen, chopped onion, celery, and bell pepper mix. Stir to combine and heat through (about 1-2 minutes).
step 1:
Add the tomato paste and dry rice to the pot. Stir and cook for about two minutes. You should hear the rice crackling and popping as it cooks. This toasts the rice and caramelizes the tomato paste for more flavor. It's okay if it begins to coat the bottom of the pot, but don't let it burn.
step 2:
Add the chicken broth and diced tomatoes (with juices) to the pot. Stir to combine and dissolve anything stuck to the bottom of the pot. Finally, add the bay leaf, cumin, smoked paprika, and oregano. Stir once more, place a lid on the pot, and turn the heat up to high. As soon as the pot reaches a full boil, turn the heat down to low and let it simmer for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, turn the heat off and let the pot sit for an additional 10 minutes, undisturbed, to continue to steam.
step 3:
Remove the lid and fluff the jambalaya. If you see the bay leaf, remove it. Serve hot topped with sliced green onion.

	unit: tsp
	name: olive oil 
	amount: 2
	unit: Tbsp
	name: water 
	amount: 1
	unit: Tbsp
step 0:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Cut the potatoes into one inch cubes. Place the potatoes in a large bowl and toss with the vegetable oil until well coated.
step 1:
Cover one or two baking sheets with foil and coat lightly with non-stick spray. Spread the potatoes out over the sheets so that they are in a single layer and not piled on top of one another (you may need two baking sheets if your sheets are smaller). Season lightly with salt and pepper, then roast in the oven for 45 minutes or until golden brown and crispy on the edges.
step 2:
Meanwhile, rinse the parsley with cool water and shake off as much excess water as possible. Tear the leaves from the stems and place them in the bowl of a food processor (it's okay if some of the stems get in, you don't have to be very precise). Also add the Parmesan, salt, lemon juice, and peeled garlic. Pulse the mixture until it is finely chopped.
step 3:
Scrape down the sides of the bowl and slowly add the olive oil through the chute while pulsing. Scrape down the sides again and add one tablespoon of water while pulsing. The pesto should be a thick, almost creamy texture at this point. Taste the pesto and adjust the oil, salt, and lemon according to your liking (depending on the size of your parsley bunch, you may need to adjust the other ingredients).
step 4:
Once the potatoes are golden brown and crispy, remove them from the oven and transfer them to a bowl. Serve the pesto spooned over top or toss the potatoes in the pesto until they are fully coated.

step 0:
Bring 3 cups of vegetable broth to a boil in a sauce pot. Stir together the cornmeal and one cup of water, then pour into the boiling broth. Stir the mixture and allow it to come back up to a simmer. Turn the heat down to low, place a lid on top, and allow to simmer for 10-15 minutes, or until very thick. Stir occasionally to prevent it from sticking to the bottom of the pot.
step 1:
Mince the garlic and slice the mushrooms. Add the olive oil, mushrooms, garlic, and thyme to a large skillet and sauté over medium heat until the mushrooms are limp. Season the mushrooms lightly with salt and pepper.
step 2:
Remove the mushrooms from the skillet (leaving any liquids behind in the skillet) and add the frozen spinach. Sauté the spinach until heated through. Season lightly with salt and pepper. (It's okay if the mushrooms and spinach are a little on the bland side because the marinara, feta, and polenta all provide a lot of flavor and salt.)
step 3:
Spoon one cup of polenta into each bowl, then top with 1/4 cup of marinara sauce (warm the marinara sauce in the microwave or a small pot if desired). Divide the mushrooms and spinach between the four bowls, then crumble 1/2 oz. of feta over each bowl. Serve warm.

	unit: cups
	name: green onions, sliced
	amount: 1
	unit: bunch
step 0:
The night before, Place your beans in a large pot and fill with enough cool water to cover the beans by a few inches. Place the beans in the refrigerator to soak over night.
step 1:
When you're ready to cook, finely dice the celery, bell pepper, and onion, and mince the garlic. Cook the celery, bell pepper, onion, and garlic in a large pot with the olive oil over medium heat until softened (5-7 minutes).
step 2:
Drain the soaked beans in a colander and rinse with fresh, cool water. Add the rinsed beans to the pot with the vegetables. Also add the vegetable broth, thyme, oregano, bay leaf, smoked paprika, some freshly cracked pepper, and a pinch of cayenne pepper.
step 3:
Place a lid on the pot and bring it up to a full boil over high heat. After it reaches a boil, turn the heat down to low and allow the pot to simmer for at least two hours. Make sure the pot is simmering the entire time, increasing the heat if needed. Stir the pot occasionally to make sure nothing is sticking to the bottom. Keep the lid in place the entire time to keep the beans from drying out.
step 4:
After two hours (or longer if desired) the beans should be soft and tender. Mash some of the beans against the side of the pot with the back of a spoon. This will thicken the pot and make the classic, creamy texture of the dish. Remove the bay leaf and allow the pot to simmer for about 30 minutes more (after smashing) to help it thicken.
step 5:
To serve, add a scoop of red beans to a bowl and top with a scoop warm, cooked rice. Sprinkle sliced green onions over top and add a dash of hot sauce if desired.

step 0:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. In a small bowl whisk together the eggs, milk, and vanilla until smooth. Set the whisked wet ingredients aside.
step 1:
In a large bowl, stir together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt until well combined. Slice the butter into chunks then add to the flour mixture. Work the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles damp sand (use your hands or a pastry cutter).
step 2:
Allow the strawberries to thaw slightly, or microwave for a few seconds until slightly softened. Roughly chop the strawberries into bite-sized pieces. Stir the strawberries and white chocolate pieces into the whisked egg mixture.
step 3:
Pour the egg mixture with strawberries and chocolate into the bowl of dry ingredients (flour, butter, etc.). Stir with a spoon until it forms a ball of dough. If necessary, use your hands to mix the last bits of flour into the dough.
step 4:
Turn the lump of dough out onto a lightly floured surface and flatten it into a 6-8 inch diameter circle (about 1.5 inches thick). Cut the circle into 8 wedges. Arrange the wedges on a baking sheet covered with parchment paper and bake for 13-15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until lightly golden brown.
step 5:
Transfer the baked scones to a cooling rack. To make the icing, stir together the powdered sugar, vanilla, and milk until smooth. Wait until the scones are completely cool, then drizzle the icing over top.**

step 0:
Squeeze the sausage from the casings into a large skillet (freeze the remaining links for later use). Cook the sausage over medium heat until fully brown. Break the sausage up into pieces as it cooks. It's okay if it sticks to the bottom of the skillet a little as it cooks.
step 1:
While the sausage is cooking, remove the woody stems from the kale, then slice it crosswise into thin strips. Rinse the kale well, then add it to the skillet. Stir it into the sausage and continue to cook until it is fully wilted (this happens within a few minutes).
step 2:
Drain and rinse the chickpeas. Add the chickpeas to the skillet and stir to combine. Pour the marinara sauce over the skillet, then top with the shredded cheese. Place a lid on the skillet and let it simmer until the cheese is melted (about 5-10 minutes).

	unit: oz
step 0:
Season the chicken thighs with a pinch of salt and pepper, then dredge each piece in flour until they are lightly coated.
step 1:
Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. When the oil is hot (it will sizzle if a pinch of flour is dropped into the oil), add the chicken. Brown the chicken on both sides (5-7 minutes each side), then remove the chicken from the skillet. While the chicken is browning, mince the garlic.
step 2:
After the chicken is removed from the skillet, add the minced garlic and sauté briefly (1-2 minutes, or just until the garlic is soft, but not brown). Add both cans of tomatoes with juices, basil, crushed red pepper, and chicken broth to the skillet. Stir to combine.
step 3:
Return the chicken to the skillet with the sauce, and spoon some sauce over top of each piece. Allow the sauce to come up to a simmer. Simmer the chicken in the sauce for 30 minutes, turning the chicken over half way through to make sure both sides receive adequate heat.
step 4:
Serve the chicken and sauce over cooked pasta and garnish with roughly chopped parsley.

	name: fresh parsley
	amount: 1/4
	unit: bunch
	name: cooked pasta of your choice
	amount: 12
	unit: oz
step 0:
Place the chicken breasts on a cutting board and cover with a large sheet of plastic wrap. Use a mallet or rolling pin to pound the chicken out to an even, 1/2 inch thickness. Cut the chicken breasts into 6 pieces, each about the size of a deck of cards. Season lightly on both sides with salt and pepper.
step 1:
Heat one tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the chicken pieces and cook until golden brown on each side (about 5 min. per side). If necessary, cook the chicken in batches to avoid over crowding the skillet. Remove the chicken to a plate once browned.
step 2:
While the chicken is browning, mince the garlic, drain the artichoke hearts and give them a rough chop. Chop the fresh parsley leaves and zest the lemon (use a small holed cheese grater or a zester to remove the thin, yellow layer of the lemon peel).
step 3:
After all of the chicken has browned and is removed from the skillet, add the second tablespoon of olive oil and the minced garlic. Cook the garlic for 1-2 minutes, or until soft and fragrant. Add the chopped artichoke hearts, diced tomatoes (with juices), dried basil, lemon zest, and about 1/8 tsp of salt. Stir to combine.
step 4:
Return the browned chicken to the skillet and nestle it down into the tomatoes and artichoke hearts. Allow the skillet to come up to a simmer, then let the chicken simmer in the skillet for 15 minutes, flipping it once half way through.
step 5:
Sprinkle the chopped parsley over top, then spoon the chicken and chunky sauce over a bowl of pasta. Top with cheese if desired.

step 0:
Mince the garlic and grate the ginger into a bowl. Add the sriracha, soy sauce, rice vinegar, honey, brown sugar, vegetable oil, and water. Stir to combine. Add the corn starch and stir until dissolved.
step 1:
Add the chicken thighs to a large zip top bag or a shallow dish. Add half of the marinade/sauce mixture to the chicken and toss to coat (be sure to stir the sauce before adding it to the chicken. The garlic, ginger, and corn starch tend to settle to the bottom.) Refrigerate for 30 minutes. Save the unused portion of the marinade for later.
step 2:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Add the chicken and its marinade to a 8x8 inch casserole dish. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, basting the chicken with the juices half way through.
step 3:
While the chicken is baking, add the second reserved marinade (the half that wasn't used with the chicken) to a small sauce pot. Bring it up to a simmer over medium heat while stirring. As soon as it reaches a simmer it will thicken into a nice glaze. Set the sauce aside.
step 4:
When the chicken is finished baking, spread the thickened sauce over each piece of chicken. Add fresh cilantro or sliced green onions and serve.

step 0:
Dice the onion and mince the garlic. Slice the jalapeño lengthwise, scrape out the seeds, and then dice the pepper. Add the olive oil, onion, garlic, and jalapeño to a large, oven safe skillet. Sauté over medium heat for five minutes, or until the onions are soft and translucent.
step 1:
Drain the beans in a colander and rinse them briefly with cool water. Add the tomato paste, diced tomatoes, and rinsed beans to the skillet. Stir to combine. If the mixture too thick to stir, add 1/4 to 1/2 cup of water.
step 2:
Add the chili powder, cumin, oregano, and salt to the skillet. Stir to combine and then allow the mixture to heat through. Taste the chili and adjust the seasonings if needed (for extra heat, add a pinch of cayenne pepper).
step 3:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. In a large bowl, stir together the cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt until very well combined. In a separate bowl or large measuring cup, whisk together the milk, egg, and oil. Pour the milk mixture into the bowl of dry ingredients and stir just until everything is moistened.
step 4:
Make sure the chili is spread evenly in the skillet and then sprinkle the cheddar cheese over top. Carefully pour the cornbread batter over the chili and cheese, and spread it around until everything is evenly covered.
step 5:
Transfer the skillet to the fully preheated oven and bake for 25 minutes, or until the cornbread is golden brown on the surface. Divide the skillet into 8 portions (cut into wedges) and then serve.

Once the pasta is tender, add the frozen broccoli florets to the water with the pasta and continue to cook for 60 seconds. Drain the pasta and broccoli in a colander.
step 1:
While the pasta is cooking, thinly slice the chicken breast. Heat one tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat, add the sliced chicken, and sauté until it is no longer pink (about 5 minutes).
step 2:
Add the pesto and chicken broth to the skillet. Stir to combine and allow it to come up to a simmer. Add the cream cheese in chunks and whisk it into the hot liquid until a smooth sauce forms.
step 3:
Add the cooked and drained pasta and broccoli to the skillet and stir to coat it in the cream sauce.

In a medium bowl, stir together the flour and baking powder until very well combined. Set the flour mixture aside. Preheat the oven to 350ºF.
step 1:
In a large bowl, beat the butter and sugar together with a mixer until they are light and fluffy (start on low speed, then increase to high). Add the eggs, vanilla, and almond extract and beat again until the mixture is very light and creamy in texture (start on low speed again, then increase to high. Beat for about one minute on high).
step 2:
Add half of the flour mixture and beat on low until the flour is incorporated. Add half of the milk and beat until incorporated (it may look a little lumpy at first). Repeat with the second half of the flour and then with the second half of the milk. The end product should be a light, fluffy cake batter.
step 3:
Rinse the cranberries and then roughly chop them so that that each berry is at least cut in half. Fold 1/2 of chopped cranberries into the cake batter. Spread the cake batter into a 9-inch pie plate coated with non-stick spray, the sprinkle the second half of the cranberries over top. Use your fingers to slightly poke the cranberry pieces down into the top of the batter. Sprinkle the almonds over top and press them lightly into the cake batter. Bake for 35 minutes, or until the cake and almonds are lightly browned on top.

step 0:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Add the ground turkey, egg, bread crumbs, soy sauce, and some freshly ground pepper to a large bowl. Peel the ginger with a vegetable peeler or by scraping the skin off with the side of a spoon. Use a small holed cheese grater to grate about two inches of the ginger straight into the bowl. Thinly slice 2-3 of the green onions and add to the bowl (save the rest for later).
step 1:
Mix the ingredients in the bowl thoroughly. Shape the meat mixture into meatballs about the size of pingpong balls. You should get 25-30 meatballs, depending on the size. Arrange the meatballs on a baking sheet covered in foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.
step 2:
While the meatballs are baking, make the sriracha glaze. In a small pot combine the soy sauce, rice vinegar, brown sugar, sriracha and 1/4 cup of the water. Heat and stir the mixture over medium heat until the brown sugar is dissolved. In a small bowl, stir together the remaining 1/4 cup of water with the cornstarch. Pour the cornstarch slurry into the pot with the glaze. Stir to combine. Allow the mixture to come up to a simmer, at which point the glaze will thicken and become glossy.
step 3:
After the meatballs are finished baking, transfer them to a large bowl and pour the glaze over top. Carefully toss the meatballs to coat in the glaze. Serve hot topped with the remaining sliced green onions.

	name: potatoes
	amount: 1 1/2
	unit: lbs
	name: salt
	amount: 1/2
	unit: tsp
step 0:
Cut the bacon into one-inch strips and add to a large pot. Cook the bacon over medium heat until it is brown and crispy.
step 1:
While the bacon is browning, dice the onion and mince the garlic. Once the bacon has browned, add the onion and garlic to the pot and continue to cook and stir over medium heat. The moisture from the onions will dissolve the browned bits from the bottom of the pot and absorb the bacon flavor.
step 2:
Once the onions are soft and translucent (5 minutes), add the split peas, chicken broth, bay leaf, and a healthy dose of freshly cracked pepper (20-25 cranks of a pepper mill).
step 3:
Allow the soup to begin heating through while you peel and cube the potatoes. Cut the peeled potatoes into one-inch cubes then add them to the soup. Place a lid on the pot, turn the heat up to high, and bring it to a rolling boil. When it reaches a rolling boil, turn the heat down to low and let it simmer gently for 45 minutes.
step 4:
After 45 minutes of simmering, test the peas to make sure they are very soft. Turn the heat off and let the soup cool slightly. Remove the bay leaf and then use an immersion blender to lightly blend the soup until it is creamy with a few chunks. If you don't have an immersion blender, carefully transfer a few cups at a time to a blender, drape a towel over the lid, and pulse the contents until smooth. Work in batches until half of the soup is blended smooth.
step 5:
Taste the soup and add additional salt as needed (I added about 1/2 teaspoon). Serve with crusty bread or garnishes like shredded cheddar cheese or sliced green onions.

step 0:
Rinse the mushrooms to remove any dirt or debris. Slice the mushrooms thinly. Drain the can of artichoke hearts and roughly chop them into bite-sized pieces. Thinly slice the onion and garlic (you can mince the garlic if you don't want large slices).
step 1:
Place the vegetable broth, olive oil, mushrooms, artichoke hearts, onions, and garlic in a large pot. Break the fettuccine in half and add it to the pot along with the oregano, thyme, and some freshly cracked pepper. Push the ingredients down under the broth as much as possible. Place a lid on the pot and bring it up to a rolling boil over high heat.
step 2:
As soon as it reaches a boil, stir the pot to evenly distribute the ingredients and prevent the pasta from sticking. Turn the heat down to low so that the pot is just simmering. Allow the pot to simmer, with the lid on, for 10-15 minutes, or until the pasta is tender and most of the liquid has been absorbed. Give the pot a stir every few minutes to prevent the pasta from sticking.
step 3:
Once the pasta is cooked through, add the frozen spinach. Allow the heat from the pasta to thaw the spinach. Stir the pot to help break up the clumps of spinach as they melt. Serve hot.

step 0:
Mince the garlic, dice the onion, and slice the carrots and celery into small pieces. Add the garlic, onion, carrot, celery, bay leaf, basil, thyme, chicken breast, water, and some freshly cracked pepper to a slow cooker. Stir to combine and then cook on high for four hours or low for eight hours.
step 1:
After cooking for four hours on high or eight hours on low, remove the chicken from the broth and place it on a cutting board (if you cooked on low heat, turn it to high now). Use two forks to shred the chicken. Return the chicken to the pot and stir in 1 tsp of salt to the soup. Keep the slow cooker covered as much as possible during this process to retain heat and maintain the temperature.
step 2:
Allow the soup to continue to cook on high while you mix the dumpling batter. In a medium bowl combine the flour, baking powder, salt, parsley, and sugar. Mix well. Add butter in small chunks and cut it in or work it in with your hands until the mixture resembles damp sand. Add the milk and stir until a very soft paste-like mixture forms.
step 3:
Remove the lid from the slow cooker and drop the dumpling batter into the soup by the heaping spoonful. Return the lid to the slow cooker and allow the dumplings to steam for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes they should have fluffed and expanded from the heat. Although they may look moist on the outside, they will be light and fluffy on the inside. Serve hot.

	unit: n/a
step 0:
Combine the herbs and spices for the blackened seasoning in a bowl. Slice the chicken breast into very thin, two inch long strips. Place the chicken strips in a second bowl, pour half of the blackened seasoning over top and toss the chicken to coat in the spices.
step 1:
Prepare a large pot of water for the pasta. Bring it to a boil over high heat and then add the pasta. Cook the pasta until tender and then drain in a colander.
step 2:
Meanwhile, thinly slice the bell peppers and onion. In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Once the skillet is hot and the butter is melted, add the chicken and sauté until cooked through. Remove the cooked chicken from the skillet, add the sliced vegetables, and sauté until they are tender and slightly wilted. Remove the vegetables from the skillet.
step 3:
Turn the heat under the skillet down to medium low. Add the can of fire roasted tomatoes and the second half of the blackened seasoning. Cut the cream cheese into small pieces and add it to the skillet. Whisk the mixture until the cream cheese has melted into the tomatoes and created a creamy sauce.
step 4:
Add the cooked chicken and vegetables back to the skillet with the sauce and stir to combine. If your skillet is extra large, add the cooked pasta to the skillet and toss to combine with the chicken, vegetables, and sauce. If your skillet is smaller, you can add the drained pasta back to the large pot it was cooked in (with the heat turned off), then add the chicken, vegetables, and sauce to the pot and stir to combine.
step 5:
Slice the green onions and sprinkle over top before serving.

	amount: 2
	unit: cups
	name: 8-inch, soft taco size flour tortillas
	amount: 8
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Cook the chicken in a countertop grill until golden brown on the outside and completely cooked through. If you don't have a grill, cut the chicken into 1-2 inch chunks and sauté in a skillet until golden brown on the outside and cooked through. Allow the chicken to cool slightly as you prepare the rest of the filling.
step 1:
Drain the pineapple chunks well, then roughly chop the chunks into smaller pieces. Rinse and drain the black beans. Roughly chop the cilantro and slice the green onions. Combine the pineapple, black beans, cilantro, green onions, cumin, red pepper flakes, salt, and shredded cheese in a bowl. Stir to combine.
step 2:
Once the chicken has cooled some, chop it into small chunks (no need to make neat or tidy shapes, just chop roughly). Add the chicken to the rest of the filling in the bowl and then stir to combine.
step 3:
Place 1/2 cup of the quesadilla filling onto a tortilla and spread it out over half of the surface. Fold the tortilla in half and then cook it in a skillet over medium heat until golden brown and crispy on the bottom. Flip and cook on the second side in the same manner. Use oil or non-stick spray in the skillet as needed to keep the tortilla from sticking (I find that I don't need either when using a non-stick skillet).
step 4:
Use a pizza slicer to cut the quesadilla into three wedges and serve hot.

step 1:
Cut the rolls in half. Add about 1/4 cup of shredded mozzarella and 1/2 oz. of feta to the bottom half of each roll. Divide the cooked spinach between the two sandwiches, then top with a pinch of red pepper flakes, plus 1/4 more shredded mozzarella on each.
step 2:
Place the top half of the ciabatta roll on the sandwiches and transfer them to a large non-stick skillet. Fill a large pot with a few inches of water to create weight, then place the pot on top of the sandwiches to press them down like a panini press. Turn the heat on to medium-low and cook until the sandwiches are crispy on the bottom. Carefully flip the sandwiches, place the weighted pot back on top, and cook until crispy on the other side and the cheese is melted. Serve warm.

step 1:
Add the chicken breast (whole) and chicken broth. Place a lid on the pot, turn the heat up to high, and allow it to come to a full boil. As soon as it reaches a boil, turn the heat down to low and allow the pot to simmer for 30 minutes. Make sure the pot does not stop simmering after turning down the heat. If it does, increase the heat slightly until it is gently simmering.

Add the minced peppers and about a teaspoon of the adobo sauce from the can to the soup. Rinse the black beans and add them to the soup, along with the frozen corn kernels and cumin. Allow the soup to come up to a simmer and cook for about 10 minutes more to allow the flavors to blend.
step 4:
Taste the soup and add about 1/2 teaspoon of salt if desired. Roughly chop the cilantro and stir it into the soup just before serving.

	name: sour cream
	amount: 8 oz
	unit: container
step 0:
To make the steak marinade, mince the garlic and combine it in a bowl with the olive oil, cumin, salt, and the juice from half of the lime (1-2 Tbsp juice). Save the other half of the lime to use in the pico de gallo. Add the marinade and steak to a zip top bag or shallow dish, make sure the steak is well coated in the marinade, and refrigerate it for about 30 minutes while the rice cooks.
step 1:
Cook the rice according to the package instructions, but substitute chicken broth for the water.
step 2:
While the rice is cooking and steak is marinating, prepare the pico de gallo. Dice the tomato and half of the onion. Combine the diced tomato, onion, juice from the second half of the lime, 1/4 tsp of salt, and a handful of roughly chopped cilantro in a bowl. Stir until combined, taste, and adjust the salt if needed.
step 3:
Rinse the black beans in a colander and allow the corn kernels to thaw.
step 4:
To cook the steak, heat a large skillet over medium-high until very hot. Add the steak and cook for 3-5 minutes on one side, or until deeply golden brown. Flip and cook in the same manner on the second side. Transfer the steak to a cutting board and allow it to rest for five minutes. If desired, thinly slice the second half of your onion and cook it in the skillet for a few minutes, or until they are caramelized.
step 5:
Once the steak has rested for a few minutes, slice it thinly against the grain (look for the lines in the meat and cut across them). To build the bowls, lay down one cup of rice, 1/4 cup each of beans, corn, and pico de gallo, a few slices of steak, a few sprigs of cilantro, and a dollop of sour cream. Serve hot.

	amount: 1
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Place the tortillas on a wire cooking rack and transfer the rack into the oven. Bake for 5 minutes, or until the tortillas have stiffened slightly, but are not yet crisp. If making more than two pizzas at once, you'll need to do this in batches.
step 1:
While the tortillas are pre-baking, thinly slice the red and green onions. Leave the tortillas on the cooling rack while adding the toppings. Top each pizza with 1-1.5 tablespoons of BBQ sauce, 1/4 cup of black beans (well drained), 1/4 cup shredded cheese, and a light sprinkle of both red and green onions.
step 2:
Transfer the cooling rack and topped pizzas back into the oven for an additional 5 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and crispy, and the cheese is melted and bubbly. The tortillas might still be slightly soft after five minutes, but will crisp up after removing them from the oven.

	unit: tsp
	name: pasta (rigatoni or your favorite shape)
	amount: 3/4
	unit: lb.
step 0:
Add the vegetable oil and sausage links (unsliced) to a large pot and cook over medium heat until the sausage is browned and firm enough to slice. It doesn't have to be cooked through at this point.
step 1:
While the sausage is cooking, thinly slice the bell peppers and onions, and mince the garlic. Once the sausage is browned, remove it from the pot and add the peppers, onions, and garlic. Let them cook while you slice the sausage into thin medallions.
step 2:
After the peppers and onions have softened, return the sliced sausage to the pot along with the diced tomatoes, basil, oregano, and crushed red pepper. Stir to combine and continue to cook over medium heat.
step 3:
Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil and cook the pasta for about 7 minutes, or just until tender, but still firm. Slightly undercook the pasta as it will continue to cook and soak up liquid once added to the pot with the sausage and peppers.
step 4:
Once the pasta is finished cooking, drain it in a colander and then add it to the pot with the sausage and peppers. Stir to combine, place a lid on top, and allow the pasta to cook in the pepper sauce for about 5 more minutes, or until it has absorbed most of the liquid in the pot. Add about a half teaspoon of salt, taste, and add more if needed.

	name: milk 
	amount: 1/2
	unit: cup
	name: grated parmesan cheese 
	amount: 1/4
	unit: cup
step 0:
Wash, peel, and slice the potatoes into thin, 1/8" thick slices. Heat the olive oil in a large oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Once the skillet is hot, add the potatoes and season with salt and pepper.
step 1:
Cook the potatoes for about 10 minutes, stirring only occasionally so that the bottom layer has a chance to brown. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
step 2:
While the potatoes are cooking, slice both the green and white ends of the green onions. Add the white ends to the skillet with the potatoes as they cook. Also roughly chop the deli ham and add it to the skillet as the potatoes cook.
step 3:
In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, and parmesan cheese. Once the mixture is fairly smooth, stir in the remainder of the sliced green onions (the green ends).
step 4:
Once the potatoes are tender, but not falling apart (about 10 minutes of cooking), pour the egg mixture into the skillet, making sure to cover all areas. Continue to cook the mixture in the skillet without stirring for 1-2 minutes, or until the edges are set.
step 5:
Transfer the skillet to the oven and continue cooking for about 20 minutes, or until the egg has puffed up and eggs are set (firm, but still moist). The center of the skillet will firm up last, so test the center for doneness. Allow the frittata to sit for five minutes before slicing and serving.

step 0:
Add the soy sauce, rice vinegar, brown sugar, toasted sesame oil, red pepper flakes, corn starch, and water to a bowl. Peel the ginger and then grate it straight into the bowl using a small holed cheese grater. If you don't have a grater, you can mince the ginger. Mince the garlic and add it to the bowl as well. Stir to combine the ingredients.
step 1:
Bring a medium pot of water up to a boil over high heat, add the noodles, and then continue to boil for 5-6 minutes, or until the noodles are tender. Drain the noodles in a colander.
step 2:
Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once the skillet is hot, add the frozen vegetables. Stir and cook for only about 2 minutes, just to slightly heat the vegetables. Briefly stir the teriyaki sauce and then pour it into the skillet. Allow it to come up to a simmer, at which point it will thicken. The vegetables will finish heating through as this happens. Turn the heat off once the sauce is hot and thick.
step 3:
Add the drained noodles to the skillet and stir until they are coated in the sauce. Divide the noodles between four bowls and then spoon any leftover vegetables from the skillet on top. Enjoy!

	name: all-purpose flour 
	amount: 1 1/2 to 2
	unit: cups
	name: large egg, optional
	amount: 1
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Dissolve the yeast and honey into the warm water and let it rest for five minutes to allow the yeast to activate.
step 1:
While the yeast is activating, roughly chop the sunflower seeds with either a knife or a mini-food processor. Add the chopped sunflower seeds to a large bowl with one cup of the whole wheat flour and the salt. Stir until evenly combined.
step 2:
By this point the yeast should be foamy and frothy in the water. Add the olive oil to the yeast water and then pour it all into the bowl with the flour and sunflower seeds. Stir until the mixture is fairly smooth.
step 3:
Add the last half cup of whole wheat flour and stir until it is incorporated. Add a half cup of all-purpose flour and stir until it forms a loose, shaggy ball of dough.
step 4:
Take the dough out of the bowl and place it onto a floured work surface. Knead the dough for five minutes, slowly adding more all-purpose flour as you go. After five minutes of kneading, the dough should be soft, supple, not sticky, and will spring back when poked gently with your finger. You should use between 1 1/2 to 2 cups of all-purpose flour total (including what was added when it was in the bowl).
step 5:
Place the dough back into the mixing bowl, cover loosely with plastic wrap or a damp towel, and let it rise for 1 to 1.5 hours, or until double in size.
step 6:
Once it is double in size, deflate it, divide it in half, and form it into two balls. Place the balls on a large baking sheet covered with parchment paper, cover with a damp towel, and allow them to rise until double again (1 to 1.5 hrs).
step 7:
Begin preheating the oven to 400 degrees. Separate the egg white and yolk. Whisk a tablespoon of water into the egg white and then brush it over the tops of each loaf. The egg wash is optional, but it will create a nice deep brown, glossy crust.
step 8:
Take a sharp knife (a micro-serrated bread knife or a very sharp chef's knife) and carefully slice an "X" in the top of each loaf. Be sure to use no downward pressure while doing this, just carefully drag the knife horizontally or you'll deflate the loaf. Bake the loaves in the preheated 400 degree oven for 25 minutes, or until golden brown on top. Allow the loaves to cool before slicing.

	amount: 3 1/2 to 4
	unit: lbs
step 0:
To make the marinade, combine the yogurt, olive oil, minced garlic, oregano, salt, and some freshly cracked pepper in a bowl. Use a fine holed cheese grater or a zester to scrape the thin layer of yellow zest from the lemon skin into the bowl. Also add the juice from half of the lemon (about 1-2 Tbsp). Stir until the ingredients are well combined. Roughly chop a big handful, or about 1/4 bunch, of parsley and stir it into the marinade.
step 1:
Add the chicken pieces and marinade to a gallon sized zip top bag. Remove as much air as possible, close the bag tightly, and massage the bag to mix the contents and make sure the chicken is well coated. Refrigerate the bag for 30 minutes.
step 2:
After marinating for 30 minutes, either cook the chicken on a grill OR preheat the oven to 375 degrees in preparation to bake the chicken.
step 3:
To bake the chicken, place the chicken pieces in a large casserole dish (9x13). Bake the chicken in the preheated 375 degree oven for 45-60 minutes, or until golden brown on top.

	unit: tsp
	name: apple cider vinegar 
	amount: 1/2-1
	unit: Tbsp
step 0:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Peel the sweet potato and then cut it into one-inch cubes. Cut the red onion into thick strips.
step 1:
Place the sweet potato cubes and red onion slices onto a baking sheet covered with foil. Drizzle 2 tablespoons of olive oil over top and then toss the vegetables to coat. Sprinkle a small amount of salt and pepper over top. Roast the vegetables for 45 minutes, or until they are tender and the edges are slightly brown.
step 2:
Meanwhile, bring a medium sauce pot of water to a rolling boil over high heat. Measure out one cup of brown lentils and then sort through them to remove any stones or debris. Once the water reaches a full boil, add the lentils. Allow the pot to come back up to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium low and let it continue to simmer for 20 minutes.
step 3:
Use a fork to retrieve a couple lentils and then taste them to make sure they are tender. Once they are tender, drain the lentils in a colander. You can return the lentils to the pot, with the heat turned off, until ready to use.
step 4:
Pull the kale leaves from their woody stems and tear them into bite-sized pieces. Rinse the kale well in a colander.
step 5:
Mince a clove of garlic and add it to a large pot along with the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Cook the garlic over medium-low heat for about two minutes, or until it is slightly softened. Add the rinsed kale leaves and saute just until the kale is about half way wilted (or wilted to your liking).
step 6:
Once the kale is wilted to the point that you like, turn the heat off. Add the drained lentils and the roasted sweet potato and red onion. Toss until everything is combined.
step 7:
Either add a dijon vinaigrette or add the cumin, cider vinegar, and some salt and pepper to taste. Start with just a half tablespoon of cider vinegar and add more if desired. Toss the salad to distribute the dressing or seasonings, and then serve.

step 0:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Wash and cut the potatoes into one-inch cubes. Place the potato cubes in a large bowl and add the olive oil, smoked paprika, garlic powder, salt, and some freshly cracked pepper. Toss the potatoes until they are well coated in oil and seasoning.
step 1:
Line a baking sheet with foil and give it a light spritz of non-stick spray. Spread the potatoes out over the baking sheet so they are in a single layer. If they don't fit, prepare a second baking sheet and divide the potatoes between the two. Roast the potatoes in the preheated oven for 45min to one hour, or until they are tender and golden brown. Stir the potatoes once, about half way through.
step 2:
When the potatoes are close to being finished, crack the eggs into a large bowl and gently whisk them. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-low heat. When the butter is melted, pour in the eggs. Gently move the eggs around the skillet until they are mostly solid, but still moist in appearance. Be careful not to over cook the eggs at this point because they will cook further upon reheating the breakfast bowls.
step 3:
To prepare the bowls, divide the roasted potatoes between six freezer safe containers. Add 1/4 cup of salsa to each container. Divide the scrambled eggs among the six containers and then top with about 1/4 cup of shredded cheese.
step 4:
Chill the bowls in the refrigerator before transferring to the freezer. Or, leave them in the refrigerator if you plan to eat them within 5-6 days.

	name: Mexican chorizo
	amount: 2
	unit: links
step 0:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Rub the outside of the poblano peppers with olive oil. Place the peppers on a baking sheet covered with foil or parchment paper and roast in the preheated oven for 30 minutes.
step 1:
After the peppers come out of the oven, allow them to cool for a few minutes and then peel away as much of the thick skin as possible (steam from roasting will help it separate from the flesh). Pull the stem to remove the seed pod and scrape any remaning seeds from inside the pepper. Roughly chop the remaining peppers into small pieces.
step 2:
Mince the clove of garlic and add it to a medium sauce pot along with one cup of milk, three cups of water, and one teaspoon of salt. Bring the pot up to a boil over high heat and with a lid on top.
step 3:
When it reaches a full boil, pour in the grits while stirring. Also stir in the chopped poblano peppers. Allow the pot to return to a boil, then turn the heat down to medium-low and allow it to continue to simmer, with the lid on, for 5-7 minutes, or until thickened. Stir in the butter until melted and adjust the salt to your liking.
step 4:
While the grits are cooking, heat the George Foreman grill for 7 minutes. Add the chorizo and cook for 5 minutes. Rotate the links and cook for 5 minutes more. Slice the chorizo into medallions.
step 5:
Scoop about one cup of grits onto each plate or bowl and top with the sliced chorizo medallions.

Once the hummus is made, carefully peel the tough skin off of the poblano pepper. Roasting creates steam which helps the skin separate from the pepper. Pull the stem off and scoop the seeds out with a spoon. Remove the jalapeño seeds in the same manner (removing the jalapeño skin is not necessary).
step 4:
Add the poblano and jalapeño peppers to the food processor with the hummus and process until smooth once again. Serve immediately or refrigerate until ready to eat.

step 2:
Allow the pot to continue to boil over medium heat, without a lid, for 10-15 minutes, or until the pasta is cooked and most of the liquid has been absorbed. Stir the pot every few minutes as it cooks to prevent the pasta from sticking to the bottom, but avoid over stirring which can cause the pasta to become sticky.
step 3:
Sprinkle with shaved Parmesan just before serving.

	unit: n/a
step 0:
Drain the black beans and rinse them briefly with water. Let them drain while you prepare the rest. Crack six eggs into a large bowl and lightly whisk them. Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a large skillet over medium-low heat.
step 1:
Once the butter is melted, pour the eggs into the skillet. Let them cook slowly over medium-low heat. As the bottom layer begins to set, use a spatula to drag the outside edges in towards the center, allowing the uncooked egg to run back into the empty space. Continue to gently move the eggs around in the skillet in this manner until they are about 75% set. The eggs will continue to cook as you add other ingredients, so you do not want to over cook them at this step. Season the eggs with salt and pepper if desired.
step 2:
Add the drained beans and 2-3 cups of tortilla strips to the skillet. Gently fold them into the eggs, breaking the tortilla strips into smaller pieces as you go. Spoon one cup of salsa over top of the egg mixture and then sprinkle one cup of shredded cheese over top.
step 3:
Place a lid on the skillet and turn the heat up to medium. Allow the skillet to heat for five minutes, or until mostly heated through. While the skillet is heating, pull the cilantro leaves from the stems and give them a rough chop. Remove the lid and gently fold the ingredients in the skillet, so that the cheese gets a little mixed in and melts slightly. Sprinkle the cilantro over top and serve hot.

	amount: 1/2
	unit: cup
step 0:
Dice the onion and mince the garlic. Add both to a large skillet with the olive oil. Use a vegetable peeler or the side of a spoon to scrape the skin from the ginger. Once peeled, grate the ginger on a cheese grater straight into the skillet. Sauté the onion, garlic, and ginger over medium-low heat for about 5 minutes, or until the onion is soft and transparent. While these are cooking, dice the tomato.
step 1:
Add the curry powder and cumin to the skillet and continue to stir and cook for one minute more. Add the diced tomato and salt. Continue to cook for about five minutes more, or until the tomato has broken down and is no longer holding its diced shape.
step 2:
Drain the chickpeas in a colander and give them a quick rinse. Add the rinsed chickpeas, frozen spinach, and a half cup of water to the skillet. Stir everything together and then bring it up to a simmer over medium heat. Let the mixture simmer for five minutes so that the flavors can meld and everything heats through.
step 3:
After five minutes most of the water should have simmered away. Turn the heat down a bit (medium-low) and add the evaporated milk. Depending on how thick you want the sauce, you can either just heat through or let it simmer until thickened. If you prefer a smoother Chana Saag, you can use an immersion blender to purée some of the mixture, or transfer half of it to a blender and carefully purée it.* I left mine chunky. Once it’s heated through, adjust the salt and curry powder to your liking.

	name: avocado
	amount: 1
	unit: n/a
	name: mayonnaise (optional)
	amount: 1/4
	unit: cup
step 0:
Wash the sweet potato well and then poke it several times with a fork so that steam can escape while it cooks.
step 1:
To cook it in the microwave: wrap it loosely with a paper towel, set it on a microwave safe plate, and microwave on high for five minutes. Carefully squeeze the potato to make sure it is soft all the way through. If it is not, microwave longer, in one minute increments, until it is soft all the way through (mine took 8 minutes).
step 2:
Took cook it in the oven: heat the oven to 400 degrees and then bake the potato for 45-60 minutes, or until it is soft all the way through (either directly on the oven rack or on a baking sheet).
step 3:
While the sweet potato is cooling, prepare the rest of the ingredients. Place the frozen corn in a large bowl. Drain and rinse the black beans. Allow as much excess water to drain away as possible, and then add them to the bowl with the corn. Roughly chop the cilantro leaves and then add them to the bowl, along with half of the cornmeal (1/4 cup), garlic powder, cumin, and salt. Take one chipotle pepper out of the can, mince it, and then add it to the bowl along with about one teaspoon of the adobo sauce from the can.
step 4:
Once the sweet potato is cool enough to handle, scoop out the flesh and add it to the bowl with the rest of the ingredients. Stir everything together and then either use a potato masher or the back of a fork to slightly mash the beans. Cover and chill the mixture for 30 minutes to allow the cornmeal to absorb some of the moisture.
step 5:
Divide the sweet potato mixture into four (or six) portions and shape each into a patty, approximately 3/4 inch thick. Use the remaining 1/4 cup of cornmeal to coat the outside of the patties. This will provide a nice crunch to the burger.
step 6:
To cook the patties in a skillet, heat 1/2 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a heavy bottomed skillet over a medium flame. When the oil is hot (it should look wavy on the surface), add two of the patties. Cook for about 5 minutes on each side or until the patties are golden brown. Add more oil and cook the remaining two patties. Remember to turn the patties carefully as they are quite soft and can fall apart.
step 7:
To cook the patties in the oven, Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Line a baking sheet with foil and then coat lightly with non-stick spray. Place the patties on the foil and then spritz the top of the patties lightly with non-stick spray (this will help it crisp up). Bake for 25 minutes, or until the patties are heated through and the bottoms are golden brown.
step 8:
Spread one tablespoon of mayonnaise on each bun and top with a chipotle sweet potato patty. Slice the avocado and place 1/4 of the slices on top of each burger. Top with extra cilantro leaves, if desired.

step 0:
STEP 1: Reheat the Multi-Purpose Shredded beef in the microwave or in a small sauce pot over low heat. While the beef is heating, thinly slice the bell peppers and onions. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
step 1:
STEP 2: Place one teaspoon of vegetable oil in a large skillet and place over a medium-high flame (or use a non-stick skillet with a little non-stick spray). When the skillet is very hot, add about 1/3 of the sliced vegetables. Saute for 2-3 minutes, or until they become soft and the edges become golden brown. Continue to cook the rest of the vegetables in small batches and replenishing the oil as needed. Try not to over crowd the skillet, which can trap the steam and cause the vegetables to stew instead of caramelize on the edges.
step 2:
STEP 3: Cut the French bread loaf into four equal pieces and then slice each piece open. Place the opened bread on a baking sheet. Divide the shredded beef between the four sets of bread. Pile the beef on one half and spoon some of the cooking juices over the other half. Add the sauteed onions and peppers on top of the beef and then top each sandwich with a slice of provolone.
step 3:
STEP 4: Bake the sandwiches in the oven for 3-5 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and the bread is slightly crispy on the edges, then EAT.

step 0:
Begin the rice first because it will take the longest to cook. Dice the onion and mince the garlic. Saute onion and garlic with butter in a medium pot over medium-low heat until the onions are soft and transparent (3-5 minutes). Add the dry rice, turmeric, cumin, and cinnamon. Stir and cook these ingredients for about 3 minutes more to toast the dry rice and spices. You should hear it crackling a little as it cooks. Make sure to stir often so that the rice does not stick to the bottom of the pot.
step 1:
Add the chicken broth and bay leaf to the pot. Place a lid on top and turn the heat up to high. Let the pot come up to a full rolling boil and then turn the heat down to low. Let the pot simmer over low heat for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, turn the heat off and let the pot sit for an additional 20 minutes without removing the lid or stirring the pot. After the final 20 minutes, fluff the rice with a fork.
step 2:
When the rice is close to being done, prepare the sauteed spinach. Mince a clove of garlic and add it to a very large pot along with the olive oil. Saute the garlic for 1-2 minutes over medium heat, or just until becomes soft and fragrant. Add the fresh spinach and saute for about 3 minutes, or just until the spinach has wilted. Season the spinach with salt and pepper to taste. Fry six eggs.
step 3:
To serve, add about one cup of warm rice to a bowl, add 1/2 cup of the sauteed spinach, and then top it off with a fried egg. Hot sauce adds a nice kick to this dish, too.

	unit: tsp
	name: shredded beef
	amount: 2
	unit: cups
step 0:
To make the mashed cauliflower, bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil over high heat. While the water is heating, remove the stem from the cauliflower and cut it into florets. Once the water begins to boil, add the cauliflower and continue to the boil it for about 10 minutes, or until it is very tender.
step 1:
Save about 1/2 cup of the cauliflower cooking water, and then drain the rest in a colander. Return the drained cauliflower to the pot with the heat turned off. Add the butter, chicken base, and one clove of minced garlic. Mash the cauliflower using a potato masher or an immersion blender, adding back some of the reserved cooking water if the moisture becomes dry. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
step 2:
To make the ragout, dice the onion and mince the garlic. Add both to a large pot along with the olive oil. Saute the onion and garlic over medium-low heat for 3-5 minutes, or until tender. Add the tomato paste and continue to stir and cook the mixture for about five minutes (this will slightly caramelize the sugars in the tomato paste).
step 3:
Stir the wine or beef broth into the tomato paste mixture. Add the diced tomatoes (with juices), basil, oregano, bay leaf, soy sauce, and brown sugar.
step 4:
Thaw your shredded beef (if frozen) and drain off the cooking liquids. Add the shredded beef to the pot and stir everything together. Allow the mixture to come up to a light simmer and let it cook for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Finally, taste the sauce and add salt as needed (I added about 1 tsp, but start with 1/2 tsp).

	unit: cups
step 0:
Cut the rump roast into chunks approximately 3 inches each. This will allow the meat to cook evenly and come up to a safe temperature faster in the slow cooker. Place the beef into the bottom of the slow cooker. Pour the beef broth over the meat, place the lid on the slow cooker, and cook on high for 4-6 hours, or until the meat is fork tender. The beef should be so tender that it shreds with the slightest pressure of a fork.
step 1:
Pull the chunks of beef out of the cooking liquid and shred it with two forks. Divide the shredded beef into freezer safe containers (approximately 2 cups of shredded beef per container) and pour some of the cooking juices over top. The juices will help prevent the beef from drying and getting freezer burn while stored in the freezer. Refrigerate the beef until completely cooled before transferring to the freezer. Always label and date packages before freezing. Keep the beef in the freezer for up to three months for best flavor and quality.
step 2:
To reheat the beef, simply transfer it from the freezer container to a small pot and heat over medium-low until fully thawed and reheated. Strain the shredded beef from the cooking liquid and season according to the recipe it is being used in.

step 0:
Make the pickled carrots first. In a small sauce pot combine the vinegar, sugar, salt, and water. Heat over medium flame and stir until the sugar is dissolved. Turn the heat off. Shred or julienne the carrots and slice the onion as thin as possible. Combine the carrots, onion, and vinegar mixture in a container. Make sure the vegetables are fully submerged in the liquid and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes (up to one week).
step 1:
Next, get the rice started. Combine 2 cups of dry jasmine rice and 3 cups of water in a medium sauce pot. Place a lid on top and bring it up to a boil over high heat. As soon as it reaches a full boil, turn the heat down to low and let it continue to simmer for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, turn the heat off and let it sit, undisturbed with the lid in place, for an additional 15 minutes, or until you’re ready to use it.
step 2:
After the rice is started, begin making the meatballs. In a large bowl combine the ground pork, egg, breadcrumbs, minced garlic, grated ginger, soy sauce, and sliced green onions. Mix these ingredients thoroughly (your hands are best for this job). Begin to preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Line a baking sheet with foil and spray it lightly with non-stick spray. Make about 30 meatballs, approximately 1 tablespoon each, and place them on the prepared baking sheet.
step 3:
Bake the meatballs in the fully heated oven for 25 minutes. While the meatballs are cooking, thinly slice the jalapeno and cut the cucumber into quarter rounds (cut it into thin spears if you’re making this in sandwich form). Pull the cilantro leaves from the stems.
step 4:
Once the rice and meatballs are both finished cooking, you’re ready to assemble! Place about 3/4 cup rice in the bottom of a bowl, add about 4 meatballs, about 1/4 cup of pickled carrots and onions, some cilantro leaves, cucumber, and jalapeno. Add a splash of soy sauce, sriracha, or mix up some sriracha mayo to top the bowls. Enjoy!

	amount: n/a
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Wash and dry the sweet potatoes. Prick the skin a few times on all sides with a fork. Use one tablespoon of the vegetable oil to lightly coat the skins. Bake the sweet potatoes for one hour in the preheated oven, or until soft all the way through. You can place the sweet potatoes directly on the oven rack, but place something on the rack below to catch any drippings, as they will ooze slightly while baking.
step 1:
When the sweet potatoes have about 15 minutes left to go, saute the spinach. Add the second tablespoon of vegetable oil and the minced garlic to a medium skillet. Saute over medium heat for 1-2 minutes, or just until the garlic becomes fragrant and slightly soft. Add the spinach (three large handfulls, or about 3 cups packed) to the skillet. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Continue to saute until the spinach is wilted (2-3 minutes).
step 2:
When the potatoes come out of the oven, carefully slice them open from end to end. Use a fork to lightly mash the insides. Add about a 1/2 tablespoon of butter or coconut oil to the inside of each potato and then season lightly with salt and pepper. Divide the spinach between the three potatoes. Top with one tablespoon of dried cranberries and chopped walnuts per potato. Serve hot!

	name: salt
	amount: 1/2
	unit: Tbsp
	name: apple cider vinegar
	amount: 1
	unit: tsp
step 0:
The night before, sort through the beans to remove any stones or debris. Place the beans in a bowl and cover them with cool water. Allow the beans to soak in the refrigerator over night.
step 1:
Slice the sausage in to medallions and add them to a large soup pot along with one tablespoon of olive oil. Saute the sausage over medium heat until it is nicely browned (about five minutes). Drain off the excess fat.
step 2:
While the sausage is browning, dice the onion, carrot, and celery into small pieces. Mince the garlic. Add the onion, carrots, celery, and garlic to the soup pot after the sausage fat has been drained off. Saute for about five minutes more. The moisture released by the vegetables will dissolve any browned bits off of the bottom of the pot.
step 3:
Drain the soaked beans and give them a good rinse with fresh water. Add the rinsed beans to the pot along with the bay leaf, thyme, rosemary, some freshly cracked pepper, and 8 cups of water. Stir everything to combine. Turn the heat up to high and allow the soup to come up to a full boil.
step 4:
Once it reaches a full boil, turn the heat down to medium-low and allow the soup to gently boil for two hours, with the lid in place. You want the beans to go past the point of tenderness to the point where they are falling apart. Stir the pot occasionally.
step 5:
After gently boiling for a couple of hours, use a large wooden spoon to smash some of the beans against the side of the pot. This will help thicken the soup. Stir in the fresh spinach until wilted. Season the soup with salt. Start with just a 1/2 teaspoon at a time and add more until it is to your desired saltiness (I used 1/2 tablespoon total). Lastly, stir in the apple cider vinegar. Serve hot.

	amount: 20 oz
	unit: can

	amount: 1/4
	unit: bunch
step 0:
Add the rice to a medium sauce pot. Mince the garlic and add it to the pot along with the salt, thyme, and crushed red pepper. Drain the can of black beans and then add them to the pot. Lastly, add the can of coconut milk and 1.5 cups of water. Stir briefly to combine the ingredients.
step 1:
Place a lid on the pot and bring it up to a full boil over high heat. As soon as it reaches a full boil, turn the heat down to low and allow it to continue to simmer for 20 minutes. Make sure that it’s still simmering after turning the heat down to low. If it is not, increase the heat slightly.
step 2:
After 20 minutes, turn off the heat and allow the pot to rest undisturbed for an additional 20 minutes. The rice will continue to steam during this time.
step 3:
After the final 20 minutes, remove the lid and fluff with a fork (it won’t look pretty at first because the coconut cream will be on top). Drain the pineapple and roughly chop the cilantro. Fold both the pineapple and cilantro into the rice mixture then serve.

	unit: tsp
	name: baking soda
	amount: 1
	unit: tsp
	name: sriracha hot sauce
	amount: 1
	unit: Tbsp
step 0:
First, pop the corn. Place the vegetable oil and corn kernel in a large pot. Place the lid on top and turn the heat up to high. When the kernel pops, add the rest of the kernels to the pot. Keep the lid on top, give the pot a shake and swirl to make sure the kernels are covered in hot oil, and they will begin to pop within a minute. Allow the kernels to continue to pop over high heat until the popping slows down (1-2 pops per 10 seconds?). At that point, turn the heat off and set the lid ajar to allow steam to escape.
step 1:
In a medium sauce pot combine the water, sugar, butter, and salt. Turn the heat up to medium and allow the sugar to dissolve and the mixture to come up to a boil. Once it reaches a boil, reduce the heat slightly so that it doesn’t boil over, and allow it to boil for about 10 minutes or until it reduces, becomes slightly thicker, and turns a light golden color.
step 2:
While the sugar is boiling, preheat the oven to 250 degrees and cover a baking sheet in foil or parchment. Spray the parchment or foil with non-stick spray.
step 3:
When the sugar takes on a golden hue, turn the heat off and stir in the baking soda and sriracha. The mixture will puff up and turn orange. Work quickly because it will begin to harden as it cools. Pour the mixture over the popped corn in the pot. Use a large spoon to quickly stir it until the corn is coated. Again, it will begin to harden as it cools, so work quickly. Spread the corn out on the prepared baking sheet and bake in the oven for 10 minutes.
step 4:
Allow the corn to cool and enjoy (responsibly).

	unit: n/a
	name: medium serrano or jalapeno pepper
	amount: 1
	unit: n/a
step 0:
To a blender add the molasses, vegetable oil, soy sauce, peeled garlic, ginger (cut into chunks, peeled), cinnamon, allspice, thyme, and nutmeg. Blend until smooth. If you want extra hot jerk chicken, add the serrano to the blender, too.
step 1:
Arrange the chicken pieces in the slow cooker so that they are nestled tightly and as close to the bottom as possible. Pour about 2/3 of the spice rub over the chicken and use your hands to spread it all over the chicken pieces. Save the rest of the spice rub for later use.
step 2:
Cut the onion into wedges and slice the orange and serrano. Add the onion, orange, and serrano to the slow cooker. Nestle the pieces down in and under the chicken so that they make close contact. Place the lid on the slow cooker, turn it on to high, and let it cook undisturbed for four hours.
step 3:
After four hours, carefully remove the chicken and place it on a broiler pan or a baking sheet covered with foil. Tongs work best for this as the chicken will be very hot and very delicate. Spread the rest of the spice rub carefully over the surface of the chicken. Adjust the rack in your oven so that the top of the chicken is 4-5 inches below the broiler. Broil on high for about 5 minutes or until the skin is crispy and browned. Watch the chicken closely as all broilers are different. Broilers can quickly burn food because of their high heat and close proximity of the heat source.

step 0:
Cut the beef into smaller, bite-sized chunks. Add the beef and flour to a small bowl and toss the beef in the flour until it is well coated.
step 1:
Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. When it is hot, add about half of the beef chunks and cook until golden brown. Once browned, remove the beef, add the second batch, and cook until browned again. Try not to stir the beef as it is browning, that will make it take longer. Adding all of the beef at once will over crowd the pot and cause moisture to build up, which will also prevent browning. The beef does not have to be fully cooked at this point, just browned on the outside.
step 2:
While the beef is browning, chop the onion into wedges and mince the garlic. After the beef has browned, add the onion and garlic to the pot, and saute it for 2-3 minutes. If the browned bits on the bottom of the pot become very dark or look like they will burn, move on to the next step immediately. The onions do not need to be fully cooked.
step 3:
Add the tomato paste and beef broth to the pot. Stir the pot until all of the browned bits have dissolved off of the bottom. Return the browned beef to the pot and also add the bay leaf, thyme, rosemary, and a generous dose of freshly cracked pepper. Stir to combine.
step 4:
Place a lid on the pot and allow it to come up to a simmer. Once it reaches a simmer, turn the heat down to low and let it continue to simmer for 30 minutes. If it stops bubbling (simmering) at any point, turn the heat up just slightly.
step 5:
While the pot is simmering, peel and slice the carrots. Wash the potatoes well and cut them into 3/4 inch cubes. Once the pot has simmered for 30 minutes, add the carrots, potatoes, and peas. Cover the pot again and let simmer for another 15-20 minutes or until the vegetables are tender.
step 6:
Stir the worcestershire sauce into the stew. Taste the stew and adjust salt and pepper if needed. Roughly chop a handful of parsley and sprinkle it over top. Serve hot.

	unit: n/a
step 0:
Thinly slice the smoked sausage and add it to a large skillet with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Saute the sausage over medium heat until it is nicely browned (about 5-7 minutes). Drain off the excess fat.
step 1:
Dice the onion and add it to the skillet. Continue to saute until the onion has softened (about 5 minutes). Add the can of diced tomatoes with chiles and the chicken broth. Stir to combine and dissolve any browned bits off of the bottom of the skillet.
step 2:
Add the uncooked pasta to the skillet and make sure it is all submerged under the liquid. Place a lid on the skillet and allow the mixture to come up to a boil. Once it reaches a boil, turn the heat down to low and let it simmer for about ten minutes, or until the pasta is tender. Stir once or twice while the pasta cooks to keep it from sticking.
step 3:
Stir in the fresh spinach, one cup at a time, until wilted. If you add it all at once, the skillet will be too full to stir. Keep the heat on while adding the spinach, so the liquid will continue to simmer and thicken.
step 4:
Sprinkle the shredded cheese on top, replace the lid, and let it sit for a few minutes, or until the cheese is melted. Slice the green onions and sprinkle them over top. Serve hot!

step 0:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. In a large bowl combine the flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, and cardamom. Stir until everything is well combined.
step 1:
Make sure the butter is cold. Cut it into chunks and then add it to the flour mixture. Use your hands to rub or smoosh the butter into the flour until the mixture has a grainy appearance.
step 2:
In a separate small bowl, whisk together the eggs and milk. Pour the egg mixture into the bowl with the flour and butter. Stir everything together until it forms one lump of very moist dough. If it remains crumbly with dry flour on the bottom of the bowl, add a small amount of water (about 1/2 to 1 tablespoon) to make it come together.
step 3:
Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and shape it into one flat disc for regular sized scones, or two flat discs for mini scones. The discs should be about one inch thick each. Sprinkle the top of the dough with granulated sugar, if desired. Cut the disc(s) into eight wedge-shaped pieces.
step 4:
Place the dough wedges on a baking sheet covered with parchment paper. Bake the scones in the fully preheated oven for 15-17 minutes or until lightly golden brown on top.

	unit: cup
	name: olive oil 
	amount: 2
	unit: Tbsp
	name: Italian seasoning blend 
	amount: 1
	unit: tsp
step 0:
Combine the warm water, yeast, and sugar, and stir until dissolved. Let that sit for about five minutes or until it becomes frothy on top. After five minutes, stir in the olive oil and salt. Pour the yeast mixture into a large bowl and add one cup of flour. Stir until smooth.
step 1:
Continue to add flour, a half cup at a time, until you can no longer stir it with a spoon. At that point turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for about five minutes, adding more flour as you go. Knead in flour until the dough is soft, but no longer sticky. You should use roughly 2.25 to 3 cups of flour total. Form the dough into a ball, place it back in the bowl, loosely cover it with plastic, and let it rise for 1-1.5 hours, or until double in size.
step 2:
Once the dough is double in size, take it out of the bowl and place it on a floured surface again. Pat the dough down into a rough rectangular shape and then gently stretch and coax the dough into a larger 12×18 inch rectangle. Stretching the dough rather than rolling it with a rolling pin will give you a fluffier end product.
step 3:
Arrange your toppings over the dough. Roll the dough up so that it forms an 18 inch log. Place the rolled dough on a baking sheet and brush with the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Sprinkle the Italian seasoning over top. Allow the stromboli to rise for about an hour.
step 4:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Bake the stromboli for 25 minutes or until golden brown on top. Slice the stromboli into 12 pieces, about 1.5 inches each. Enjoy!

	name: bunch cilantro 
	amount: 1/4
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Use a wire mesh sieve to rinse the quinoa very, very well (this removes the bitter taste). If you don’t have a wire mesh sieve, you can put the quinoa in a bowl with water, swish it around and carefully pour off the water. Repeat this process until the water is fairly clear.
step 1:
Put the rinsed quinoa in a medium pot along with the clove of garlic (minced), salt, chili powder, cumin, oregano, smoked paprika, and 1.5 cups of water. Stir to combine. Put a lid on the pot, turn the heat on to high, and bring it up to a boil. As soon as it reaches a boil, turn the heat down to low and let simmer for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, turn the heat off and let it sit (with the lid in place) for an additional 10 minutes.
step 2:
While the quinoa is cooking, prepare the pico de gallo according to these directions (it’s as easy as chop and stir). Rinse the black beans well in a colander and allow the excess water to drain off.
step 3:
When the quinoa has finished cooking, remove the lid and fluff with a fork. Add the drained black beans and stir to combine.
step 4:
Lightly toast the tortillas in a skillet over medium heat until each side is just slightly golden brown (tortillas should still be pliable). To make each taco, place about 1/4 cup of the quinoa/black bean mixture in the center of a tortilla. Add about 1-2 tablespoons of pico de gallo, one slice of avocado, and a few sprigs of cilantro. Fold and eat!

step 0:
If you don’t have cooked jasmine rice on hand, begin cooking your rice first so it will be ready by the time the chicken and sauce are complete. To begin the sauce, mince the garlic and then peel and grate the ginger into a large skillet or pot. Saute both in the vegetable oil over medium heat for about 2 minutes or until they are soft and fragrant.
step 1:
Cut the chicken into small pieces (about one inch across). Add them to your skillet or pot. Saute until lightly browned and cooked through (about 10 minutes).
step 2:
Turn the heat down to low and add the coconut milk and peanut butter. Stir gently to combine the two and dissolve any browned bits off of the bottom of the pan. Once the sauce is relatively smooth, add the soy sauce, brown sugar, sriracha, and juice from half of the lime. Stir to combine and heat through (about ten minutes).
step 3:
Pull the cilantro leaves from their stems and roughly chop. Scoop about one cup of jasmine rice into the bottom of each bowl and then top with the chicken and sauce (about 3/4 cup). Sprinkle the fresh cilantro over top and enjoy!

Place the quinoa in a wire sieve and rinse thoroughly for 1-2 minutes with cool water. If you don’t have a wire mesh sieve, place the quinoa in a bowl, fill it with cool water and swish the quinoa around. Allow it to settle and then carefully pour out the water. Repeat 4-5 times. Rinsing quinoa well is essential to remove its natural coating, which can cause the quinoa to taste bitter.
step 1:
Place the rinsed quinoa in a medium pot. Add the juice, salt, cinnamon, and cloves. Stir briefly. Place a lid on top and bring the pot up to a boil over high heat. As soon as it reaches a boil, turn the heat down to low and allow it to simmer for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, turn the heat off and allow it to rest, without removing the lid, for ten minutes.
step 2:
Meanwhile, chop the apple into small bite-sized pieces. Also roughly chop the walnuts.

	unit: Tbsp
	name: vegetable broth*
	amount: 1
	unit: cup
step 0:
Stir together the dijon mustard, soy sauce, 2 tablespoons olive oil, brown sugar, pepper, and minced garlic in a bowl. Place the pork tenderloin and prepared dijon marinade into a large zip top bag. Massage the bag to make sure the marinade covers all surface of the tenderloin. Refrigerate for at least two hours.
step 1:
When ready to prepare the tenderloin, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Remove the excess marinade from the tenderloin and then when the oil in the skillet is hot (it should look wavy on the surface), add the tenderloin to the skillet. Cook the tenderloin for about five minutes on each side or until golden brown. Remove the skillet from the heat.
step 2:
Transfer the browned tenderloin to a baking sheet covered in foil. Bake the tenderloin in the preheated oven for 30 minutes or until the internal temperature reaches 145 degrees.
step 3:
While the tenderloin is baking, prepare the pan sauce. Add the butter to the still warm skillet (heat off) and allow it to melt. Either add 1/4 cup of the marinade or 1 tablespoon each of dijon and brown sugar to the skillet. Also add 1 cup of vegetable broth. Place the skillet over medium heat and whisk the mixture until all of the browned bits on the bottom of the skillet have dissolved off. Allow the mixture to simmer, whisking occasionally, until the volume has reduced by about half (about 15-20 min). NOTE: Never re-use the raw, uncooked marinade and never marinate at room temperature.
step 4:
When the tenderloin is finished, allow it to rest for 5-10 minutes before slicing. Spoon some of the pan sauce over top and slice into 12-16 pieces. Serve with more pan sauce.

	unit: cup
	name: salt
	amount: 1/4
	unit: tsp
step 0:
The night before, combine the flour, salt, and yeast in a bowl. Stir to combine. Add just enough water to make the mixture form a ball of dough with no dry flour left on the bottom of the bowl. This will be around 3/4 cup of water. Loosely cover the bowl and allow the dough to rest at room temperature for 12-18 hours.
step 1:
The next day, about an hour and a half before you plan to eat, thinly slice three small (or 2 medium/large) yellow onions. Saute the onions in a skillet over medium-low heat with 2 tablespoons of olive oil for about 45 minutes, stirring the mixture every 2-3 minutes. The end result should be deep golden brown, soft, sweet onions. For a more detailed, step by step photo tutorial on how to caramelize onions, check here.
step 2:
While the onions are cooking, slice the mushrooms. Take the caramelized onions out of the skillet and add the mushrooms, along with a pinch of salt and pepper and the dried thyme. There should be some residual oil in the skillet to cook the mushrooms, if not add a tad more. Cook the mushrooms until all of the moisture has evaporated away (about 10 minutes over medium heat).
step 3:
While the mushrooms are cooking, prepare the cream sauce. Mince a clove of garlic and add it to a pot with 1 tablespoon of butter. Saute over medium heat until softened (about 2 minutes). Next, add the cream cheese, milk, and 1/4 teaspoon of salt. Heat and whisk this mixture until a smooth sauce forms (about 5 minutes).
step 4:
Adjust the rack in your oven to its highest position and begin to preheat to 500 degrees. The dough at this point should be at least double in volume and very bubbly (see photos below). Sprinkle it generously with flour and then scrape it out of the bowl and onto a floured surface. Pat the dough down into a circle about ten inches in diameter. Transfer the dough to a large (16-inch) pizza pan that has been coated with non-stick spray and stretch/press it the rest of the way out to the edges of the pan.
step 5:
Spread the sauce over the surface of the dough with the back of a spoon. Sprinkle the caramelized onions and sauteed mushrooms over top. Finally, add the shredded mozzarella. Bake the pizza in the fully preheated 500 degree oven for 12-15 minutes or until the crust is golden brown. Sprinkle with chopped fresh parsley after baking, if desired.

	name: chicken broth**
	amount: 2
	unit: cups
step 0:
Cut the bread into one inch cubes, spread them out onto a baking sheet, and bake for 15-20 minutes in a 350 degree oven or until dry and crispy.
step 1:
While the bread is drying, dice the onion, mince the garlic, and chop the celery into small pieces. Cook all three in a large pot over a medium flame with olive oil until softened (about five minutes). Turn off the heat.
step 2:
Drain the can of artichoke hearts and roughly chop them into smaller, bite-sized pieces. Add the chopped artichoke hearts to the pot along with the oregano, sage, salt, and pepper. Stir until combined.
step 3:
Roughly chop the feta cheese into small pieces. Pull the parsley leaves from the stems and roughly chop as well. Add both to the pot along with the dried bread cubes.
step 4:
Whisk the eggs in a bowl, add the chicken broth and whisk again. Drizzle this mixture over the contents in the pot. Stir until the bread cubes are moistened and everything is evenly mixed. Pour the contents of the pot into a casserole dish coated with non-stick spray. Use a 9×13 inch baking dish for a shallow stuffing, or add it all into an 8×8 inch casserole dish for a thicker-deeper stuffing.
step 5:
Cover the casserole dish with foil and bake at for 20 minutes at 350 degrees. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes to allow the top to get crispy. If you’re using the smaller dish (8×8), add about 15 minutes to the covered baking time (40 minutes covered, 25 minutes uncovered).

	name: vegetable oil for frying
	amount: 1/4
	unit: cup
step 0:
Place the pork chops in a zip top bag or another shallow, spill proof container and cover with the buttermilk. Allow the pork to marinate in the refrigerator for two hours or over night.
step 1:
Prepare the breading by combining the bread crumbs, salt, garlic powder, parsley, dill, and cracked pepper in a bowl. For each chop, allow the excess buttermilk to drain off and then dip it in the seasoned bread crumbs until all surfaces are well coated.
step 2:
To fry the pork chops, heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. When the oil is nice and hot, add two chops to the skillet and fry for 2-3 minutes on each side or until golden brown. Add the second 2 tablespoons of oil and cook the second two chops in the same manner. Transfer the fried chops to a baking sheet and bake in a preheated 375 degree oven for 30 minutes or until the center of the pork chops are no longer pink. OR...
step 3:
To bake the pork chops, place a wire cooling rack over a baking sheet to keep the chops lifted off of the baking sheet. This will allow heat and air to reach the bottom of the chop and reduce sogginess. Bake the chops for 45 minutes to one hour or until the center is no longer pink. If the breading is not golden brown by the time the inside of the chops are cooked, place the chops under the oven broiler for a few minutes on each side (adjust the rack so that the chops are about 4-6 inches from the heat).

step 0:
Dice the onion and mince the garlic. Cook both in a large pot with olive oil over medium heat until soft and transparent (about 5 minutes). Add the tomato paste and continue to stir and cook for about 3-4 minutes more. The tomato paste will caramelize during this time, which will make it sweeter and cause it to look slightly darker.
step 1:
While the ingredients in the first step are cooking, peel and dice the potato and carrots. Rinse the lentils. Once the tomato paste has caramelized, add the carrots, potato, and lentils to the pot.
step 2:
Also add 6 cups of vegetable broth, cumin, smoked paprika, and cayenne pepper. Give everything a good stir to make sure it’s mixed well. Place a lid on top, turn the heat up to high, and bring the soup to a boil. As soon as it reaches a full boil, turn the heat down to its lowest level and allow it to simmer for 30 minutes.
step 3:
After it has simmered for 30 minutes give the pot a stir and add the salt, starting with 1/2 teaspoon. Add more if desired. I used about 3/4 teaspoon total. Serve hot!

	name: cinnamon
	amount: 1/4
	unit: teaspoon
	name: nutmeg
	amount: 1/8
	unit: tsp
step 0:
Rinse the sweet potato to remove any dirt and then prick with a fork. Loosely wrap the sweet potato in a paper towel, place on a microwave safe plate, and then microwave for 5 minutes on high. Squeeze the sweet potato to see if it is soft all the way through, and microwave for a few minutes longer if it isn’t. Allow the sweet potato to cool slightly, and then scoop out the cooked flesh.
step 1:
Cook the grits according to the package directions. (Add four cups of water and one teaspoon of salt to a medium sauce pot and bring to a boil over high heat. Once it reaches a rolling boil, pour in the uncooked grits. Stir the mixture until it comes back up to a boil, then reduce the heat to the lowest setting, place a lid on top, and let simmer for ten minutes.)
step 2:
Meanwhile, add the cooked sweet potato flesh to a blender and add just enough milk to allow the sweet potato to blend into a puree. I used about one cup of milk. It’s okay if there are a few sweet potato chunks.
step 3:
After the grits have cooked, remove the lid and give them a good stir to help them finish absorbing the water. Add the sweet potatoes and stir until well mixed. Next add the butter, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Stir again until smooth. Taste and adjust salt, butter, or other seasonings to your liking. Serve hot.

step 0:
Mince the garlic and dice the onion. Cook both in skillet with olive oil over medium heat until soft and transparent (about 5 minutes).
step 1:
Add the ground beef, oregano, salt, and worcestershire sauce. Cook until the beef is no longer pink, breaking it up into pieces as it cooks (7-10 minutes).
step 2:
Once the beef is fully cooked, add the frozen spinach. Cook and stir until it has thawed and heated through, breaking up clumps as you go.
step 3:
Briefly whisk 6 eggs in a bowl. Push the beef and spinach mixture to one side of the skillet (or make a well in the center) and pour in the eggs. Gently scramble the eggs until they are cooked through, but still moist. Try not to mix them into the meat as they cook or you’ll have beef coated in egg, rather than clumps of cooked egg. Once the egg is cooked, stir it into the beef mixture and turn off the burner.
step 4:
Crumble or roughly chop the feta cheese and sprinkle it over the skillet. Also sprinkle with grated parmesan cheese. Stir to combine, taste, adjust the salt if needed, and then serve.

step 0:
Preheat your oven to 400 degrees. Chop the zucchini, bell pepper, onion, and mushrooms into bite-sized pieces. Toss the vegetables with 2 Tbsp olive oil, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp cumin, and 1/2 tsp oregano. Spread the vegetables out over a large sheet pan and roast for 40 minutes, stirring once half way through.
step 1:
Combine the rice in a medium pot with 1 tsp of salt and 1/2 Tbsp of chili powder. Add 3 cups of water, place a lid on top, and bring up to a boil over high heat. As soon as it reaches a full boil, turn the heat down to the lowest setting and allow it to simmer for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, turn the heat off and let it sit undisturbed until you’re ready to assemble the burritos. Fluff the rice just before using.
step 2:
When you’re ready to make the burritos, stack a few tortillas on a large plate, place a damp paper towel over top, and microwave for 30 seconds. This will make the tortillas more pliable as you wrap the burritos.
step 3:
Place 1/4-1/3 cup of rice on a tortilla, add 1/4 cup of black beans, 1/3 cup of the roasted vegetables, 1/4 cup of shredded cheese, and a handful of fresh cilantro leaves. Roll the burrito tightly and wrap in plastic until ready to eat.

	unit: Tbsp
	name: large egg for glaze, optional
	amount: 1
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Dice the onion into small pieces and mince the garlic. Cook both in a small skillet with 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat until soft and transparent (about five minutes).
step 1:
While the onions and garlic are cooking, prepare the rest of the filling. In a bowl combine the cottage cheese, parmesan cheese, eggs, salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Mix well. Before adding the spinach, strain it in a colander and press out as much moisture as possible (squeezing handfuls in a fist works well too).
step 2:
Once the onions have softened, add them to the cheese/egg mixture along with the squeeze dried spinach. Stir until well combined.
step 3:
Dust a clean work surface with flour and unfold a sheet of puff pastry onto it. Using a rolling pin, roll the puff pastry into a 12 inch by 12 inch square. Drape the rolled dough over a standard 9 inch pie dish.
step 4:
Spread the spinach filling evenly inside the pastry lined pie dish. Fold the corners of the pastry back over top of the filling. It’s okay if they do not fully reach to meet each other. If desired, brush a whisked egg over the top (this will give the surface a glossy appearance after cooking).
step 5:
Bake the pie for 45 minutes in a preheated 375 degree oven. Allow the pie to rest for about 5 minutes before cutting to allow the filling to set.

step 1:
Add the can of tomato sauce, the can of crushed (or diced) tomatoes, and one can full of water to the pot. Add the basil, oregano, a healthy dose of freshly cracked pepper, and stir to combine. Increase the heat to medium-high and bring up to a simmer (about 10 minutes).
step 2:
Add the frozen tortellini and frozen spinach (no need to thaw either one). Cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally to break up the frozen spinach. Cook until the heated through, the spinach has completely incorporated, and the tortellini is tender (about 10 minutes). Season to taste with salt – I used 2 teaspoons.

	amount: 1/2
	unit: n/a
	name: bunch parsley 
	amount: 1/4
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Remove the chicken from its packaging over the sink and allow the juices to run out. Remove the giblets from the cavity and discard them. Fold a long piece of foil lengthwise to form a sturdy sling and place the chicken on it (see photos below).
step 1:
Cut the lemon in half and then cut one of the halves into quarters. Stuff the quarters inside the cavity of the chicken. Peel the garlic cloves and stuff them into the cavity along with the whole sprigs of parsley.
step 2:
Take the second half of the lemon and place it face down in the center of the slow cooker. This will help the chicken sit up off of the bottom of the cooker. Using the foil sling, lift the chicken into the slow cooking, placing it on top of the lemon. Fold the sides of the sling into the cooker, secure the lid, and cook on high for four hours.
step 3:
After cooking on high for four hours, carefully lift the chicken out of the slow cooker using the foil sling and place on a baking sheet. Set the broiler to its low setting and cook the chicken under the broiler (5-6 inches from the flame) until the skin is golden brown and crispy (5-10 minutes). Let the chicken rest for 10 minutes before cutting or serving.

	amount: 3-4
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Dice the onion and mince the garlic. Cook both in a large skillet over medium heat with the olive oil until soft and transparent (about 5 minutes).
step 1:
Add the ground beef and continue to cook until browned. Mix together the taco seasoning ingredients while the beef is browning. Once the beef is fully cooked through, add the taco seasoning and stir to combine. Drain the beans and add to the skillet. Stir until combined. Taste and season with salt as needed (I used about 1 teaspoon).
step 2:
Allow the beef and bean filling to sit while you cook the pasta shells. Bring a large pot to a boil, add the shells and cook just until tender. Be sure not to over cook the shells or they will be soft and difficult to fill. While the pasta shells are cooking, prepare the enchilada sauce.
step 3:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Drain the shells in a colander and rinse with cold water until they are cool enough to handle. Spray the inside of a 9×13 inch casserole dish with non-stick spray. Fill the shells with the beef and bean filling and place in the casserole dish. It’s okay if they’re not aligned neatly or if they topple over and spill some filling, it will still be good.
step 4:
Once all of the shells are filled and in the casserole dish, pour the prepared enchilada sauce over top and then add the shredded cheese. Cook in the preheated oven for about 30 minutes or until the cheese is melted and everything is heated through (all ingredients are already cooked, so there is no real danger of undercooking here. You just want to get it all HOT).
step 5:
Slice the green onions and sprinkle over top after it comes out of the oven. Serve hot!

step 1:
Add the tomato paste and honey. Allow it to heat through as you stir. It will not form a smooth sauce. Continue to stir and heat over low for about 5 minutes or until you notice the tomato paste has darkened slightly. Either use immediately or refrigerate until ready to use!

step 0:
Chop the onion and mince the garlic. Cook in a large skillet with olive oil over medium heat. While onion and garlic are cooking, peel and dice the sweet potato. Add the diced sweet potato to the skillet and continue cooking.
step 1:
Remove the seeds from the poblano and jalapeno peppers, dice both, and add to the skillet. Also add the black beans (drained and rinsed), enchilada sauce, and sliced green onions. Stir and heat through. Taste the mixture and add the chili powder, cumin, and salt. Adjust to your liking.
step 2:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. To make the cornbread topping, combine the dry ingredients in a large bowl (flour, cornmeal, sugar, salt, and baking powder). Stir until evenly combined. Next, add the wet ingredients (milk, egg, vegetable oil, shredded cheese, and roughly chopped cilantro leaves). Stir these ingredients into the dry ingredients just until everything has become wet and the mixture looks even. Slightly beating the egg before adding it helps make this easier.
step 3:
To build the tamale pie, pour the vegetable mixture into a deep pie dish, cast iron skillet, or 8×8 inch casserole dish. Next, pour the cornbread mixture over top and smooth it out evenly. Bake the pie in the preheated 425 degree oven for about 25 minutes or until the top of the cornbread is golden brown.

step 0:
Slice the chicken breasts on a diagonal into six strips each. Place the strips in a quart sized zip top bag along with 1/4 cup of balsamic vinegar, one clove of garlic (minced), 1 Tbsp of olive oil, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Mix the ingredients in the bag and let marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.
step 1:
When you’re ready to cook, heat the second tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. When the oil is hot, cook the strips until browned on both sides (about 2-3 minutes each side). You may have to do two batches. Place the cooked chicken on a clean plate.
step 2:
Turn the heat down on the skillet to medium-low and add the butter and last 2 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar to the skillet. Use a spoon to stir the mixture and dissolve the sticky bits off of the bottom of the skillet. Once the mixture has dissolved together, add the honey, increase the heat, and allow the sauce to simmer until thickened (about five minutes).
step 3:
Once the sauce has thickened, season to taste with salt and pepper (I just used a pinch of each). Add the chicken back to the skillet and toss to coat in the warm balsamic sauce. Serve immediately.

	name: plain yogurt
	amount: 1
	unit: cup
	name: garlic
	amount: 1
	unit: clove
step 0:
Begin by cooking the sweet potatoes. The fastest way to do this is in the microwave. Prick the skin of each potato with a fork. Wrap one potato in a paper towel, place it on a plate, and microwave on high for 5 minutes. Carefully remove it from the microwave, squeeze it to make sure it’s soft in the center, and the allow it cool as you cook the next one. When the potatoes are cool enough to handle, cut them open and scoop the flesh into a large bowl.
step 1:
Slice the green onions and roughly chop a handful of cilantro (about 1/8th of a bunch). Add the green onions, cilantro, frozen corn kernels, salt, cumin, and cayenne pepper to the bowl with the cooked sweet potatoes. Stir until well combined. You can taste it at this point and adjust the seasoning as desired.
step 2:
Add the breadcrumbs, cornmeal, and egg to the bowl. These ingredients will bind the mixture together and keep it from falling apart while cooking. Stir until evenly combined. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for 30 minutes to allow the breadcrumbs to absorb moisture.
step 3:
While the sweet potato mixture is refrigerating, mix up the garlic sauce. In a small bowl combine the yogurt, one clove of well minced garlic, and a handful of cilantro leaves (roughly chopped). Stir until combined and then refrigerate until ready to serve.
step 4:
After the sweet potato mixture has refrigerated, it’s time to cook. Add enough vegetable oil to fully cover the bottom of a medium skillet. Heat the oil over medium-high heat until the surface appears wavy (if it begins to smoke, remove it from the burner immediately and turn down the heat). Shape the sweet potato mixture into small patties (about 2-3 Tbsp each) and cook about 4 at a time in the hot oil. Cook until golden brown on each side; about 2 minutes per side. After cooking, place on a paper towel covered plate to drain. Add more oil to the skillet as needed.

After it has baked 30 minutes, remove the loaf from the oven and spoon half of the sriracha glaze over top. Bake for an additional 30 minutes. Spoon the remaining glaze over top and bake for a final 15 minutes. A meat thermometer placed in the center of the loaf should read 160 degrees Fahrenheit.
step 4:
Allow the loaf to rest for ten minutes before slicing.

step 0:
Cut the chicken breasts into small chunks. I cut each breast into 3-4 strips lengthwise, and then each strip into 4-5 chunks to yield approximately 40 pieces. Place the chicken pieces in a large zip top bag.
step 1:
Add to the rest of the ingredients to the bag (yogurt, minced garlic, grated ginger, lemon juice, salt, coriander, cumin, turmeric, cayenne, garam masala, and 1/2 Tbsp of the paprika). Close the bag tightly and smoosh it around to mix the ingredients. Place the bag in the refrigerator for 2 to 24 hours to marinate.
step 2:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Cover a baking sheet with foil and spray with non-stick spray. Wipe the marinade from the chicken pieces and place them in a bowl. Sprinkle the last tablespoon of paprika and a pinch more of salt over the chicken pieces (add more cayenne if hot chicken pieces are desired). Toss to coat. The extra paprika here just helps the red color, you can skip it if desired. A little extra salt definitely helps, though.
step 3:
Place the chicken pieces on the prepared baking sheet, spaced out so they do not touch. Bake for 15 minutes in the fully preheated oven. Take the sheet out, turn each piece of chicken over, and bake for an additional 15 minutes. Serve warm.

	unit: 4 oz. 
step 0:
Brown the ground beef in a large pot over medium along with 1 Tbsp of olive oil. Once browned, drain off the excess fat. While the beef is browning, dice the onion and mince the garlic.
step 1:
Add the diced onion and minced garlic to the browned and drained beef. Continue to cook and stir over medium heat until the onions are soft and translucent. Once the onions have softened, add 2 Tbsp of flour and cook for one minute more while constantly stirring. It’s okay if it coats the bottom of the pot, just make sure the heat is not so high that the flour burns.
step 2:
Add the chili powder, smoked paprika, oregano, tomato sauce, and 2 cups of beef broth (or beef base/bouillon cubes and water). Stir to dissolve any bits that are stuck to the bottom of the pot.
step 3:
Add the dry pasta, place a lid on top, and allow it to come up to a simmer. Once it reaches a simmer, reduce the heat to low, and let simmer for about 15 minutes or until the pasta is soft and has absorbed all of the liquid. Stir every few minutes to make sure it’s not sticking on the bottom of the pot. If it gets dry before the pasta has fully softened, add a touch of water.
step 4:
Once the pasta has finished cooking, turn the heat off and stir in the shredded cheese. Serve hot.

step 0:
Using a sharp knife, cut approximately 1/2 inch off the top of the head of garlic. Place the garlic bulb in a small bowl or dish and drizzle 1/2 tablespoon of olive oil over the exposed cloves. Cover the bowl with an inverted plate. Microwave on high, in one minute increments, until the garlic is soft and fragrant (about 2 minutes). Use caution when touching the dishes, they will be very hot. Allow the garlic to cool.
step 1:
Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil, add the pasta, and cook for 7-10 minutes or until al dente. Reserve 1/2 cup of the starchy pasta cooking water.
step 2:
While the pasta is cooking, squeeze the garlic cloves from the head and mince well. Add the minced garlic to a medium bowl along with the ricotta cheese, a healthy dose of freshly cracked pepper, and about 1/2 tsp of salt. Add the 1/2 cup of hot, starchy pasta cooking water. Stir until it forms a smooth sauce.

Drain the pasta. Return the drained pasta to the warm pot (the burner should be turned off). Add the fresh baby spinach and pour the ricotta sauce over top. Slice the cherry tomatoes and add them to the pot as well. Stir until everything is well mixed. Add in the parmesan cheese and stir again. Taste and add salt and pepper to taste. Serve warm!

step 1:
When you’re ready to cook the chops, heat 2 Tbsp of vegetable oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat. When the oil is very hot (it will look wavy in the pan), add the chops. Cook for about 7 minutes on each side or until cooked through and the marinade has reduced to a thick sauce. No need to pour all of the marinade into the skillet, the amount that comes off of the chops as they cook will be plenty to make a nice sauce. Discard the extra marinade from the bag. Serve hot!

step 0:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Use a pizza cutter to slice the tortillas into thin strips. Line a baking sheet with foil and coat it with non-stick spray. Spread the tortilla strips out in a single layer and spritz lightly with more non-stick spray. Sprinkle lightly with salt.
step 1:
Bake the tortilla strips for 15-20 minutes or until they are golden brown and crispy. Stir the tortilla strips half way through cooking.
step 2:
While the tortilla strips are baking, cut the head of lettuce into small pieces. Rinse the lettuce and drain well (or use a salad spinner). Also chop the tomato and slice the green onions. Rinse the black beans in a colander to remove the starchy canning liquid. Remove the corn from the freezer and allow it to thaw.
step 3:
Whisk together all of the ingredients for the dressing (yogurt, buttermilk, mayonnaise, salt, garlic powder, chili powder, cumine, and cayenne). Makes about 1.5 cups or 6 servings of 1/4 cup each.
step 4:
Once the tortilla strips are finished cooking, the dressing is made, and all of the salad ingredients are prepped, build the salad! You can either build one big salad and then serve or build individual portions. Layer the lettuce first, then black beans, corn, tomato, shredded cheese, green onion, and a few tortilla strips on top.

	name: sour cream 
	amount: 8
	unit: oz.
	name: small avocados 
	amount: 2
	unit: n/a
step 0:
In a skillet over medium heat, lightly toast the corn tortillas on both sides. If you are using a non-stick or cast iron pan, no oil is needed. If you are using a stainless steel or other cooking surface, you may need a quick spritz of non-stick spray. The tortillas should be lightly browned in some spots but still pliable.
step 1:
Sort and rinse the lentils. Bring 3 cups of water to a rolling boil in a medium pot. Once it reaches a boil, add the lentils. Let the pot return to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, place a lid on top. Allow the lentils to simmer for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, taste the lentils to test the texture. They should be tender but not mushy. Drain the lentils in a colander. (For a step by step picture tutorial on how to cook lentils, click here)
step 2:
While the lentils are simmering, prepare the pico de gallo (instructions here). Also mix together the taco seasoning, including the corn starch (instructions here).
step 3:
Dice the onion, mince the garlic and cook them with olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat until tender. Once the onion is tender, add the drained lentils, the taco seasoning, and about a half cup of water. Stir and cook over medium heat until the mixture has thickened (about 3-5 minutes). Season to taste with salt – this will really bring out the flavors (I added one teaspoon).
step 4:
Build the tacos, using about 1/4 cup of seasoned lentils per taco, one slice of avocado, a small amount of pico de gallo, and sour cream. If you have cilantro left over from the pico de gallo, it can also be used to top the tacos.

	unit: tsp
	name: olive oil 
	amount: 1/2
	unit: cup
step 0:
Rinse the parsley well and shake off as much water as possible. Remove the leaves from the stems and place them into the food processor. Also add the garlic (peeled), parmesan cheese, and lemon juice. Pulse until there are no large chunks of garlic left.
step 1:
Slowly add the olive oil through the spout on the lid as you continue to pulse the mixture. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed and pulse until smooth. Taste the pesto and add salt to your liking. I added 1/4 teaspoon. You want the pesto to be slightly saltier than you’d think because it will be spread out thin over the pasta.
step 2:
Cook the pasta according to the package directions (this can done while you make the pesto). Before draining the pasta, reserve about a half cup of the starchy cooking water. Drain the pasta, let cool slighly (about 5 minutes) and then return it to the pot. Add the pesto and stir to coat. If the pasta becomes dry, clumpy, or sticky, use a small amount of the pasta water to help loosen it up. Serve warm!

	amount: 1
	unit: cup
step 0:
Remove the chorizo from the casings and saute in a large skillet over medium heat until cooked through. Drain the excess grease from the skillet.
step 1:
While the chorizo is cooking, remove the kale leaves from the stems and tear into small pieces. Place in a colander and rinse well. Once the chorizo is fully cooked and drained, add the kale to the skillet. Cook until the kale is fully wilted.
step 2:
Begin to preheat the oven to 350 degrees. In a bowl, whisk the four eggs until they are fairly smooth. Next, whisk the milk and parmesan into the eggs. If you will be baking the frittata in the cast iron skillet, pour the egg mixture directly over the cooked chorizo and kale. If you are cooking the frittata in a casserole dish, spray it lightly with non-stick spray, add the cooked chorizo and kale to the bottom, and then pour the egg mixture over top.
step 3:
Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella over the top of the frittata. Place in the preheated oven and bake for about 45 minutes or until the frittata looks puffy and golden brown on top. Slice into six pieces and serve hot.

	amount: 8
	unit: oz.
step 0:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Wash the potatoes well and peel if desired (I like to leave the peel on for extra texture and flavor). Cut the potatoes into strips or “fries”, approximate 1/2 inch thick.
step 1:
Place the fries in a bowl and add the olive oil and worcestershire sauce. Toss to coat. In a small bowl combine the chili powder, smoked paprika, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and cornstarch. Stir to combine the spices, then add to the bowl with the fries. Toss to coat once more.
step 2:
Line a baking sheet (or two) with foil and spray lightly with non-stick spray. Spread the fries out on the baking sheet so that they are in a single layer and not piling up on each other. Use two baking sheets if needed. Bake for 40 minutes, stirring once halfway through.
step 3:
After 40 minutes, they should be slightly brown and crispy on the edges. If you cut your fries thicker, they may need more time in the oven. Transfer the fries to an oven safe casserole dish. Top with the shredded cheese and return to the oven for about 5 minutes more or until the cheese is fully melted. Chop the onions while the cheese is melting. Top the fries with the green onions and dollops of sour cream. Serve immediately!

step 1:
Remove the skin from the chicken thighs if desired. Place the chicken thighs either on a roasting pan or a baking sheet covered with foil. A roasting pan can be simulated by placing wire cooling racks over a baking sheet to allow juices to fall below the chicken. Brush the honey spice mixture over the surface of the chicken thighs, using about half of the total honey mixture.
step 2:
Place the chicken thighs in the fully preheated oven. Roast for about 20 minutes. Remove the chicken thighs from the oven and use the remaining honey spice mixture to brush on a second coat. Return the chicken to the oven and roast for another 20 minutes. Serve hot.

	amount: 1/4
	unit: bunch
	name: long grain rice
	amount: 2
	unit: cups
step 0:
Begin by marinating the shrimp. Prepare the marinade by combining the chili powder, honey, and soy sauce with the juice of one lime, one clove of minced garlic, and one teaspoon of vegetable oil. Rinse the shrimp and shake off excess water. Add the marinade, stir to coat, and refrigerate until ready to cook.
step 1:
Begin to cook the rice. Combine 2 cups of dry rice with four cups of water. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat. As soon as it reaches a full boil, turn the heat down to the lowest setting and let simmer for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, turn the heat off and leave it covered until ready to serve. Fluff with a fork just prior to serving.
step 2:
Prepare the seasoned black beans. Add 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil to a medium pot and add two cloves of minced garlic and one seeded and minced jalapeno. Saute for about one minute and then add the cumin. Saute for one minute more and then add the black beans. Stir and heat through.
step 3:
Prepare the pineapple salsa. Drain the can of crushed pineapple well. Cut the red onion into a small dice. Remove the seeds from the jalapeno and cut it into a small dice. Roughly chop 1/4 bunch of cilantro. Combine the pineapple, jalapeno, red onion, cilantro, the juice of one lime, and 1 tsp of salt in a bowl. Stir until combined. Taste and adjust the salt and cilantro as desired.
step 4:
To cook the shrimp heat a large skillet over a medium flame. Add the shrimp and all of the marinade. Cook just until the shrimp is opaque and has curled up. Remove the shrimp from the skillet and continue to let the marinade simmer until it has reduced and thickened (about five minutes more). Pour the thickened marinade back over the shrimp and stir to coat.
step 5:
Build the shrimp bowls. Place one cup of rice in the bottom of a bowl. Top with about 3/4 cup seasoned black beans and about 1/2 cup of pineapple salsa. Place 7 or 8 shrimp on top. Garnish with extra cilantro if desired. Dig in!

	amount: n/a
	unit: n/a
step 0:
In a large bowl combine the dry ingredients: flour, brown sugar, salt, yeast, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, and raisins. Stir until evenly combined.
step 1:
Starting with one cup, add warm water until the dough forms one cohesive ball and no dry flour is left on the bottom of the bowl (see photos below). This will be anywhere between 1.25 to 1.75 cups of water, depending on the moisture level of your flour. Having the dough be a little too wet is better than it being a little too dry. Loosely cover the bowl and let stand at room temperature for two hours.
step 2:
After two hours the dough should be light and fluffy (see photos below). Sprinkle lightly with flour and remove the dough from the bowl. Place the dough on a lightly floured surface and gently knead a few times to make the texture of the dough even. Shape the dough into a log the same length as your bread pan. Place the loaf in a bread pan coated with non-stick spray. Loosely cover with a moist towel and let rise until double (about 1-1.5 hours depending on the temperature in your kitchen).
step 3:
Preheat your oven to 425 degrees. Lightly brush the top of the bread with water. Cook the loaf in the preheated oven for about 30 minutes or until it is a deep golden brown on top. After baking, remove it from the bread pan and allow it to completely cool on a wire rack before slicing. Enjoy!

	unit: n/a
step 0:
Bring a large pot of water to a boil and cook the pasta according to the package directions (boil for 7-10 minutes or until al dente). Drain in a colander.
step 1:
While the pasta is cooking, begin the rest of the dish. Mince the garlic. Heat 2 Tbsp of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and saute for 1-2 minutes. Add the red pepper flakes and saute for 1 minute more.
step 2:
Squeeze the Italian sausage out of the casing into the skillet. Break it up with a spatula as it cooks. Saute until cooked through. Add the broccoli (thaw before hand) to the skillet and saute for 3-5 minutes or just until the broccoli is tender. Turn off the burner to prevent the broccoli from over cooking (it will begin to turn an olive green color if it overcooks).
step 3:
When the pasta is cooked and drained, add it to the skillet with the sausage and broccoli. Stir to coat it in the garlic and red pepper infused oil. Sprinkle with salt and freshly cracked pepper to taste. Sprinkle with shredded cheese, stir, and serve warm!

	unit: n/a
step 0:
Begin to boil a large pot of water to cook the pasta. When it reaches a full boil, add the pasta and cook for 7-10 minutes or until al dente. When the pasta is finished cooking, reserve 1/2 cup of the starchy pasta water and then drain the pasta in a colander.
step 1:
While the pasta is cooking, thaw the broccoli in the microwave and begin to make the parmesan sauce. Mince the garlic and cook it over medium heat in a medium sauce pot with the butter until the garlic has softened slightly (3-5 minutes). Add the flour, stir and cook for 2-3 minutes more. This is the “roux” that will thicken the sauce.
step 2:
Whisk in the milk. Increase the heat to medium-high. Whisk the milk mixture until it comes up to a light simmer. As soon as it reaches a simmer it will thicken and should be able to coat a wooden spoon (see photos below). Turn the heat off and whisk in the parmesan cheese. Add freshly cracked black pepper, nutmeg, and salt to taste. Make the sauce slightly saltier than you’d prefer if you were eating the sauce alone. Once it’s spread out over the pasta and broccoli it will taste more mild.
step 3:
Return the cooked pasta to the large pot that it was boiled in (with the burner turned off). Add the reserved pasta cooking water and toss the pasta to loosen it up. Add the thawed broccoli and then pour the parmesan sauce over top. Stir to coat everything in the sauce and then serve!

	name: water 
	amount: 3 3/4
	unit: cups
	name: whole green onions 
	amount: 2
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Place the ground pork in a large bowl. Peel the ginger and then grate it using a small holed cheese grater into the bowl. Mince the garlic, slice the green onions, and add them to the bowl. Also add the egg, breadcrumbs, soy sauce, and black pepper. Mix these ingredients really well until it is all evenly combined (clean hands work best).
step 1:
Cover a baking sheet with foil. Roll the meatball mixture into small balls, about one tablespoon each. You should yield about 30 meatballs. Place the meatballs on the baking sheet as you roll them. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown (about 35-40 minutes).
step 2:
While the meatballs are in the oven, begin cooking the rice according to the package directions: Place the rice and water in a medium pot, cover, and bring to a rapid boil over high heat. As soon as it reaches a full boil, turn the heat down to the lowest setting. Allow to simmer on low for 20 minutes, then turn the heat off and let the rice rest, undisturbed, until the rest of the meal is complete. The rice will continue to steam even after the heat is turned off, so don’t remove the lid.
step 3:
While the meatballs are in the oven, also prepare the teriyaki glaze. In a medium pot combine the soy sauce, water, brown sugar, rice vinegar, and sesame oil. Peel and grate the ginger into the pot. Heat over a low flame until the brown sugar is dissolved (just a few minutes).
step 4:
Dissolve the cornstarch in just enough water to make it pourable. Pour it into the pot with the glaze ingredients. Turn the heat up to medium high, stir and cook until thickened. It should thicken as soon as it begins to simmer. Once thickened, add the sesame seeds.
step 5:
When the meatballs come out of the oven, transfer them from the baking sheet into the pot with the glaze. Stir to coat. Fluff the rice with a fork. Build the bowls by placing one cup of rice in a bowl, add five meatballs and a couple of spoons of extra teriyaki glaze, then sprinkle a few sliced green onions over top.

step 0:
Peel the ginger (use a vegetable peeler) and grate it into a medium sauce pot with a small cheese grater. Mince the garlic and add it to the pot along with 1 Tbsp of vegetable oil. Saute the garlic and ginger over medium heat, just until soft (about one minute).
step 1:
Add the soy sauce, pineapple jam, and rice vinegar. Bring the mixture up to a simmer over medium heat. Dissolve the cornstarch in just enough water to make a slurry and pour it into the bubbling sauce. Allow to simmer for about five more minutes. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
step 2:
Prepare a baking sheet with foil and nonstick spray. Place the chicken thighs on the baking sheet. Reserve about 1/3 of the pineapple teriyaki sauce in a bowl for spooning over the chicken after cooking (you don’t want to contaminate this with raw chicken). Using about half of the rest of the sauce, brush a thick layer over the chicken.
step 3:
Place the pineapple teriyaki coated chicken in the preheated oven and bake for about 20 minutes. Take the chicken out and brush with more sauce (not the sauce reserved for after baking). Brush as much on as possible. Place back in the oven and bake until the sauce turns golden brown and bubbly (about 30 minutes more).
step 4:
Take the chicken out of the oven and allow to rest for about 5 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a serving dish and spoon some of the reserved (uncontaminated) sauce over top.

	amount: 1
	unit: tsp
step 0:
Finely dice the celery and onion. Peel the carrots and then grate them on a cheese grater. Mince the garlic or use pre-minced from a jar. Add all of this to the slow cooker. Clean the potatoes well, cut into one inch cubes or smaller, and add them to the slow cooker.
step 1:
Prepare 6 cups of chicken broth by dissolving the chicken base in 6 cups of water (or use homemade or store bought broth). Add to the slow cooker. Add some freshly cracked black pepper (about a 1/4 tsp). Secure the lid on the cooker and cook on high for approximately 8 hours (give or take an hour).
step 2:
Open the slow cooker and test the potatoes for tenderness. They should be very soft. The onions and celery should also be very soft and transparent. Whisk 1/4 cup of flour into 2 cups of milk and then stir that mixture into the soup. Secure the lid once more and let cook on high for another 30 minutes.
step 3:
After 30 minutes, the soup should once again be bubbling. It needs to be bubbling for the flour to have it’s full thickening power. Use a potato masher, immersion blender, or a hand mixer to “mash” the potatoes. Or, you can transfer half of the soup to a blender and puree (be careful, it’s HOT) until smooth and then stir it back in to the rest. Taste the soup and add salt as needed (about one teaspoon). Serve hot.

step 0:
First prepare the vegetables. Peel the ginger and grate with a small holed cheese grater. Peel and grate the carrots on a large holed cheese grater. Mince the garlic (if using fresh rather than pre-minced). Clean and slice the green onions and mushrooms. Peel the outer leaves from the cabbage, cut into quarters, remove the core, and then slice thinly into shreds.
step 1:
In a very large skillet or wok, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat and saute the green onion, garlic, and ginger until slightly softened (1-2 minutes). Add the mushrooms and continue to saute until softened (about 5 minutes). Add the carrot, saute for one minute more, then add the cabbage. Continue to cook and stir until the cabbage has reduced in volume by half (increase the heat to medium-high if necessary).
step 2:
Dissolve the cornstarch in the soy sauce. Add that to the skillet and stir to coat the vegetables. The heat will cause the mixture to thicken and create a soy sauce glaze. Drizzle the sesame oil over top and stir in. Turn the heat off. Give the mixture a taste and adjust the soy sauce and sesame oil to your liking. Transfer the mixture to a bowl to cool.
step 3:
Begin to fill and roll the egg rolls. Place one wrapper at a time on a clean surface and place about 1/4 cup of the cabbage mixture just off center, close to one of the corners on the square. Roll the corner up and over the filling, fold each side in, and then roll the rest of the way up. Keep a small bowl of water near by and use it as “glue” to hold the corners of the egg roll wrapper in place. (See step-by-step photos below)
step 4:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Prepare a baking sheet by covering with foil. Place the egg rolls on the baking sheet and coat with non-stick spray. Roll them over and coat the other side (you can brush with vegetable oil if you’re opposed to non-stick spray). Bake in the fully preheated oven for about 20 minutes or until golden brown and crispy. Turn the egg rolls over half way through cooking and rotate your baking sheet if you have hot spots in your oven.

	unit: lbs
step 0:
Cut the bacon into small pieces by cutting across the strips. Cook bacon in a large pot until crispy. While the bacon is cooking, wash and cut the celery, onion, and apples into a dice.
step 1:
Add the onion, apples, celery, and garlic to the cooked bacon. Saute just until slightly softened (about five minutes). Turn off the heat and add the thyme, sage, freshly cracked pepper, and salt to taste.
step 2:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. If your bread is fresh, slice it and place it in the oven as it heats up to dry it out. Or, buy the bread a couple of days ahead of time and allow it to dry out or get stale on your countertop. Once the bread is dry, cut it into small cubes. Also wash and roughly chop the parsley. Add the cubed bread and parsley to the cooked vegetables and bacon. Stir until everything is well mixed.
step 3:
Mix one teaspoon of chicken base with one cup of hot water. Pour this over the bread mixture and stir until everything is well coated. Transfer the stuffing mixture to a large 9×11 inch glass casserole dish.
step 4:
Unwrap the turkey pieces and rub the skin with olive oil. Sprinkle generously with salt and freshly cracked pepper. Arrange the turkey pieces over the stuffing in the casserole dish. Place the whole dish in the oven and let roast, uncovered, for one and a half hours. The turkey skin should be brown and crispy and the stuffing should be bubbling around the edges. Allow the casserole to rest for about 10 minutes before serving. This will allow the stuffing to soak up some of the moisture and solidify, as well as the turkey juices to redistribute within the meat.

	amount: 2
	unit: Tbsp

	amount: 2
	unit: cups
step 0:
Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Meanwhile, dice the onion (and mince the garlic if using fresh rather than pre-minced). Add the onion and garlic to the hot oil and saute until tender (5 min).
step 1:
If using fresh carrots and celery, clean and slice them while the onions are sauteing. Add them to the pot and cook for about 5 minutes more.
step 2:
Add the chicken breast (whole), bay leaf, oregano, thyme, cracked pepper, dry rice, and 6 cups of water to the pot. Do not add salt yet. Bring the pot up to a boil over medium high heat, then reduce the heat to low and let simmer for one hour.
step 3:
Near the end of the hour, begin to make the creamy milk mixture. In a small pot, melt 2 Tbsp of butter over medium heat. When it is fully melted, whisk in 2 Tbsp of all-purpose flour. Cook and stir the butter and flour mixture for two minutes. Whisk in the milk and allow it to come up to a simmer, whisking occasionally to keep it from scorching on the bottom. Once it reaches a simmer, it will have thickened slightly.
step 4:
Carefully remove the chicken pieces from the soup and shred or dice with a knife and fork. Rinse and chop the parsley. Add the parsley and the thickened milk mixture to the soup. Season with salt to taste. I used about 2 tsp of salt, but start with a little and add more as needed. I also added a touch more pepper at this point. Serve hot!

	amount: n/a
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Cut the ends off of the squash to provide a flat, stable surface. Stand the squash on one end and use a vegetable peeler to remove the skin. Slice a few rounds off of the small end to shorten the squash, and then cut down through the center of the thick end to expose the center. Use a spoon to scoop out the seeds and center pulp. Cut the remaining squash into small cubes.
step 1:
Heat 2 Tbsp of olive oil in a large pot or skillet over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the cubed squash, sage, salt & pepper (a generous sprinkle). Saute until the squash tender (about 10-15 min). They will looks slightly translucent and will start to smash a little like a cooked potato. Taste a cube or two to make sure they’re cooked through. Turn the heat off.
step 2:
While the squash is cooking, cook the pasta. Bring a pot of water to a boil and add a generous sprinkle of salt to the pasta water for flavor. Cook the pasta according to the package directions (boil for 7-10 minutes or until al dente). Drain the pasta.
step 3:
Once the squash is tender and the pasta is drained, add the pasta, cranberries, and chopped parsley to the pot. Stir to combine.
step 4:
Drizzle the last 2 Tbsp of olive oil over everything and add salt and pepper to taste. Lastly, stir in the shredded parmesan. Serve warm!

	unit: - 1 1/2 cups
	name: chocolate chips 
	amount: 1/2
	unit: cup
step 0:
In a large bowl, combine the dry ingredients: flour, salt, yeast, brown sugar, and cinnamon. Stir until there are no clumps.
step 1:
Add 1 cup of water. Stir and add more water, a few tablespoons at a time, just until the dough forms one ball with no dry pieces on the bottom of the bowl. It is okay if the dough is wet and sticky. Cover the bowl loosely and let it rest for two hours at room temperature.
step 2:
After two hours, sprinkle some flour on the expanded dough and on a clean work surface. Flour your hands and transfer the dough to the work surface. Give the dough just a few quick “kneads” just to make sure it is evenly mixed (honestly only 3 or for turns/folds). Shape the dough into a long rectangle with the short end the same length as your bread pan (see photos).
step 3:
Roughly chop the chocolate chips into small pieces. Sprinkle them over the surface of the bread dough. Working from the short end, stretch and roll the dough up with the chopped chocolate inside. Stretch the dough as you roll and roll tightly so that there as much “swirl” as possible.
step 4:
Place the rolled up dough, seam side down, in a bread pan coated with non-stick spray. Cover loosely and let rise until double in size (about one hour).
step 5:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees, place the risen loaf inside, and bake until deep golden brown on top (about 35 minutes). Remove the baked loaf from the pan and let cool on a wire rack before cutting open. Enjoy!

step 0:
Squeeze the sausage out of the casings and cook over medium heat, along with the olive oil, in a large pot. Break up the sausage into pieces and cook until no pink remains.
step 1:
While the sausage is cooking, dice the onion, peel and slice the carrots, and slice the celery. When the sausage is fully cooked, add the onion, carrot, celery, and garlic. Stir and cook until the onions are soft.
step 2:
While the vegetables are softening, take the opportunity to slice the rest of the carrots and celery and package them to freeze (they’ll be ready for your next soup!). Pull the kale leaves from the stems and tear into small pieces. Place the torn kale leaves in a colander and rinse well. Once the onions in the pot have softened (the other veggies may not be soft, that’s okay), add the kale. Stir and cook for about 5 minutes or until the kale is wilted.
step 3:
Drain the can of beans and add them to the pot. Also add the chicken base, water, oregano, cumin, red pepper, and black pepper. Stir to combine and heat through (about 10-15 minutes). Taste the soup and adjust the salt and other seasonings if necessary (I added about 1/2 tsp of salt). Serve hot with crusty bread!

	name: cheddar, shredded
	amount: 4
	unit: oz.
step 0:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Allow the corn to thaw (this is very important). Place the milk and half of the corn into a blender or food processor and puree.
step 1:
In a large bowl, whisk together the corn/milk mixture, half & half, eggs, cornmeal, honey, cayenne, salt, and the rest of the corn kernels. Make sure to whisk really well so that the egg is fully incorporated or else you’ll end up with chunks of baked egg in your pudding. If your corn is still frozen, the honey will not dissolve so make sure the corn is no longer cold.
step 2:
Shred 4 ounces of cheddar cheese. Stir half of it into the corn pudding mixture. Coat a 8×8 (or similar size) baking dish with non-stick spray and pour in the pudding. Sprinkle the rest of the cheese on top.
step 3:
Bake in the preheated oven for about one hour or until the center of the pudding shakes like a bowl full of jelly. Check the pudding at about 50 minutes by shaking the dish slightly. If the center wiggles like a liquid, let it cook just a little bit longer.
step 4:
Allow the pudding to rest for about five minutes after baking. Serve warm!

step 0:
Trim the excess fat from the chicken breasts and cut each piece into two. Cover the chicken with plastic wrap and pound the pieces down to one inch in thickness (use a rolling pin or heavy pan to pound).
step 1:
Place the chicken pieces in a container or zip top bag along with 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar, 1/2 Tbsp olive oil, 1/4 tsp minced garlic (or one clove if using fresh), and a healthy pinch of salt and pepper. Mix everything around to make sure the chicken is coated in the marinade. Refrigerate until ready to cook.
step 2:
Prepare the bruschetta topping. Finely dice the onion and tomatoes. Combine them in a bowl with the minced garlic, balsamic vinegar, and olive oil. Stir well, taste, and add salt and pepper to your liking (I like generous salt in this mix, about 1/2 tsp).
step 3:
Grill the chicken until cooked through (I used my countertop grill, it only took 5 minutes). Turn the oven on to broil and adjust the rack so that is about 6 inches below the heating element.
step 4:
Place the grilled chicken pieces on a baking sheet covered with foil. Top each piece of chicken with about 1/4 cup of the tomato bruschetta topping and about 1/4 cup of shredded cheese. It’s okay if some falls off, you can scoop it onto your plate along with the chicken. Place the baking sheet in the oven under the broiler. Cook just until the cheese is fully melted (5-10 minutes). Serve hot!

	unit: cup
	name: dry jasmine rice 
	amount: 1 1/2
	unit: cups
step 0:
Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium high heat. When the oil is very hot (but not smoking), add the beef. Cook the beef until it is well browned and all of the juices have cooked off (about 15 minutes).
step 1:
While the beef is cooking, dice the onion. Peel the ginger with a vegetable peeler or scrape the skin off with a spoon and then grate about 2 inches on a cheese grater. Add the onion, ginger, and minced garlic to the pot with the beef and cook until tender (about 5 minutes).
step 2:
Add the allspice and cinnamon to the pot. Stir and cook for about one minute. Add the red wine to deglaze the bottom of the pot. If you’re not using wine, the water in the next step will do the same.
step 3:
Add the water, the tomato paste, honey, crushed red pepper, and salt. Give everything a good stir to dissolve the tomato paste. Let it come up to a boil then reduce the heat to low, place a lid on top, and let it simmer for one hour.
step 4:
While the stew is simmering, cook the jasmine rice. Add the dry rice and 3 cups of water to a medium pot. Bring it up to a boil with a lid in place. As soon as it reaches a rolling boil, reduce the heat to the lowest setting and let simmer for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, turn the heat off and let the pot sit, undisturbed, until you are ready to serve.
step 5:
When the stew has simmered for about an hour, roughly chop the apricots and add them to the stew along with the raisins. Let the stew simmer for another 15-20 minutes without a lid to allow it to thicken. You may need to increase the heat just slightly to keep it simmering without the lid to hold the heat in.
step 6:
Fluff the rice with a fork, pile some into a bowl, and then ladle the stew on top. Enjoy!

	amount: 1
	unit: Tbsp
step 0:
In a small bowl, whisk together the 2 Tbsp. vegetable oil with the soy sauce, chili powder, lime juice, and garlic. To get the most juice out of your lime, microwave it for about 20 seconds before cutting it open.
step 1:
Place the pork loin in a large zip top bag and pour in the marinade. Squish the mixture around to make sure the loin is completely coated and then refrigerate for one hour or more.
step 2:
When ready to cook, take the pork loin out of the refrigerator. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Heat a large skillet with the remaining 2 Tbsp. of vegetable oil over medium-high heat. When the skillet is very hot and the oil looks wavy on the surface, add the pork loin (do not discard the marinade yet!). Sear both sides of the pork loin until brown and crispy (about 3-5 minutes each side).
step 3:
After searing both sides of the pork loin, place it on a baking sheet or roasting pan. Baste the loin with the remaining marinade and place it in the oven. Roast for approximately 30 minutes or until the internal temperature reaches 160 degrees. Allow it to rest for 5 minutes before slicing.

step 0:
Preheat the oven to 400ºF. Dice the onion and mince the garlic. Sauté the onion and garlic with olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat until the onions are soft and transparent (about 5 minutes).
step 1:
While the onion and garlic are sautéing, slice the zucchini, yellow squash, tomato, and potato thinly (1/4-inch slices). Make sure the potatoes are very thin so that they soften quickly while in the oven.
step 2:
Coat the inside of an 8x8" casserole dish with non-stick spray. Spread the sautéed onion and garlic in the bottom of the dish. Arrange the other sliced vegetables, stacked vertically like dominos, in an alternating pattern. Season the top of the vegetables generously with salt, pepper, and dried thyme.

step 0:
In a medium bowl, whisk together the ricotta cheese, olive oil, egg, salt, and freshly cracked pepper.
step 1:
Add the flour, 1/2 cup at a time, until it forms a soft sticky dough (about 1.5 cups)
step 2:
Begin boiling a large pot of water. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead in about another 1/2 cup of flour or until the dough no longer sticks to your hands. The dough should still be very soft in texture.
step 3:
Divide the dough into six pieces. Roll each piece out into a rope about 1 inch thick. Cut the rope into 1 inch sections. If desired, roll each piece of dough on the back of a fork to give it a ridged texture.
step 4:
When the water is boiling vigorously, drop the dough pieces into the water. As the gnocchi boil they will begin to rise to the surface. Once all of them are floating on top, let them boil for about 30 seconds to one minute more to ensure thorough cooking. Drain in a colander.
step 5:
Top drained gnocchi with your favorite sauce or garlic butter, salt, and pepper. Enjoy!

step 0:
Begin by cooking the pasta according to the package directions – boil for 7-10 minutes or until al dente. Drain the pasta in a colander.
step 1:
While the pasta water is heating up, slice the sausage into medallions, 1/2 inch thick. Cook the sausage in a large skillet over medium heat until it is well browned. Drain on a plate lined with paper towels.
step 2:
While the pasta and sausage are cooking, thinly slice the bell peppers, onion, and celery. Place the vegetables in a very large bowl. (While you’re at it, wash and slice the rest of the celery and freeze for use in a soup on another day)
step 3:
After the pasta and sausage finish cooking, allow them to cool slightly. While they are cooling, make the vinaigrette. Whisk together the oil, vinegar, mustard, garlic, salt, cayenne, paprika, and black pepper.
step 4:
Place the slightly cooled pasta in the bowl with the vegetables (don’t worry if it’s slightly stuck together, the vinaigrette will loosen it. Don’t use water!). Add the cooked sausage, pour the vinaigrette over everything and stir to coat. Roughly chop 1/3 bunch of parsley and add it to the salad, stirring again until evenly mixed in. Serve warm or cold!

	amount: 1

step 0:
Arrange the chicken pieces in a large pot in one layer. Remove the skin if desired.
step 1:
Combine the rest of the ingredients (soy sauce, vinegar, honey, oil, garlic, bay leaves, peppercorns) in a bowl and whisk until the honey is dissolved. Partially crush the peppercorns if desired. Pour the marinade over the chicken. Cover and refrigerate for a few hours or over night.
step 2:
When you’re ready to make the chicken, add just enough water so that the liquid comes just up to the top of the chicken (about 1/2 cup). Cover the pot with a lid, place the pot over a high flame, and bring it up to a rolling boil. When it reaches a boil, reduce the heat to medium/low and let simmer for 30 minutes.
step 3:
Preheat your broiler on high. Remove the chicken from the pot and place it on a broiler pan (or a sheet pan with wire cooling racks placed on top). Place the chicken under the broiler until it is brown and crispy on top (5-10 minutes), depending on your broiler).
step 4:
While the chicken is broiling, turn pot with the soy/vinegar liquid up to high and bring up to a rapid boil. Allow the liquid to boil heavily until it is reduced in volume by approximately one half. You may need to boil it for 5-10 minutes longer than the chicken is in the oven to get it to this point.
step 5:
Use a soft brush to baste a few layers of the reduced soy/vinegar liquid onto the browned chicken. Serve over rice or noodles and spoon more of the reduced liquid over top.

step 0:
Prepare an 8×8 baking dish by lining with foil or parchment paper. If you have a hard time lining the sides with parchment, just cut a piece to fit the bottom and then coat the sides with non-stick spray.
step 1:
In a large pot, combine the chocolate chips, sweetened condensed milk, and salt. Turn the heat on to the lowest setting and melt the ingredients together while continuously stirring. Use a heavy bottomed pot and stir constantly to prevent scorching. Heat and stir until the mixture is completely smooth.
step 2:
Stir in the peanuts and marshmallows. The peanuts and marshmallows will make the temperature of the fudge drop quickly so it may look slightly gritty. Just continue to stir over low heat until it smoothes out again.
step 3:
Spread the mixture out into the prepared baking dish and refrigerate until it is completely cold. Remove the fudge from the dish and cut into 16 squares with a sharp knife. Enjoy!

Add the can of tomatoes, roughly chopped olives, basil, crushed red pepper, salt, and cracked black pepper. Stir to combine. Nestle the tuna steaks down into the sauce, place a lid on top and let simmer until the tuna is cooked through. The tuna will turn from mauve to white as it cooks. When it is completely white, it is done.
step 3:
While the tuna is poaching in the sauce, cook the pasta according to the package directions (boil for 5-7 minutes or until al dente). When the pasta is finished, drain in a colander.
step 4:
When the fish and pasta are finished cooking, gently lift the fish out of the skillet and then stir in the freshly chopped parsley and pasta. Serve the pasta with sauce and vegetables topped with a piece of tuna steak.

	amount: n/a
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Cut the broccoli into “two bite” sized pieces. If the broccoli is cut too small, it may dry up too much in the oven. Too large and you’ll need to cook it longer.
step 1:
In a large bowl (big enough to hold all of the broccoli), combine the vegetable oil, sesame oil, sambal, garlic, and brown sugar. Stir until it is evenly combined. Add in the broccoli florets and stir until it is well coated in the sambal mixture (stir longer than you’d think and it will eventually coat the broccoli well).
step 2:
Spray a baking sheet with non-stick spray and then spread out the seasoned broccoli florets so they are in a single layer. Sprinkle the broccoli generously with salt.
step 3:
Roast in the oven for 25 minutes or until the broccoli is just softened but is still crisp in the center. The edges will be browned and slightly wilty. Eat it up!

	amount: 1/2
	unit: cup
	name: uncooked jasmine rice
	amount: 1 1/2
	unit: cups
step 0:
Prepare the marinade for the chicken. Dissolve 1 Tbsp of corn starch in 1 Tbsp of water and then add 1 Tbsp of vegetable oil, 1 Tbsp of soy sauce, 1 Tbsp of rice wine, and 2 tsp of minced garlic. Stir to combine.
step 1:
Cut the chicken into small chunks and place it in a bowl or small container. Pour the marinade over top, stir to coat, cover, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
step 2:
While the chicken is marinating, prepare the sauce. The sauce is very similar to the marinade but with a couple more ingredients to amp up the flavor. So, again, start by dissolving 1 Tbsp of corn starch in 1 Tbsp of water. Then add 2 Tbsp soy sauce, 2 Tbsp rice wine, 2 Tbsp sambal, 2 Tbsp brown sugar, and 1 tsp sesame oil. Stir to combine and dissolve the brown sugar. Set the sauce aside until you’re ready to use it.
step 3:
Prepare the vegetables. Dice the bell pepper and slice the carrots into strips as thin as possible. Slice the green onions, both the white and green will be used. Measure out 1/2 cup of peanuts.
step 4:
Begin to cook the rice. Add 1.5 cups of dry jasmine rice to a medium pot with 2.5 cups of water. Place a lid on top and bring to a boil over high heat. As soon as it reaches a boil, reduce the heat to the lowest setting and let simmer for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, turn the heat off and let the rice sit undisturbed until it is ready to use. Fluff with a fork just prior to serving.
step 5:
Heat 2 Tbsp of vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. When the oil is very hot (it will look wavy on the surface), add the white half of the sliced green onions. Stir and cook for about 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add the marinated chicken. Cook and stir until the chicken is cooked through, about 5 minutes. It will feel firm when it is cooked through.
step 6:
Add the vegetables and peanuts and stir to combine with the chicken. Immediately add the sauce and cook until the sauce has thickened (2-3 minutes). I prefer the vegetables still crunchy so I didn’t really let them cook before adding the sauce.

step 0:
Mince or grate the ginger using a fine-holed cheese grater. Finely dice the onion and mince the garlic. Add the ginger, garlic, and onion to a pot with the olive oil and sauté over medium-low heat until soft and transparent (about 5 minutes).
step 1:
Add the cumin and red pepper to the pot. Stir and cook for about 1-2 minutes to allow the spices to toast just slightly.
step 2:
Add the pumpkin purée and coconut milk to the pot and stir to combine. Add the chicken broth and stir to combine again. Turn the heat up to medium and allow the soup to heat through. Once heated, taste and add salt and pepper to your liking (I added 1/4 tsp salt and 10 cranks of the pepper mill).
step 3:
Rinse the cilantro, pull the leaves from the stems, and then give them a rough chop. Stir in a handful of the chopped cilantro just before serving. If you want a smooth soup with no chunks of onion, use an immersion blender prior to adding the cilantro.
step 4:
If desired, garnish each bowl with 2 Tbsp plain yogurt, a drizzle of sriracha, and a sprinkle of pepitas.

	amount: 1/4
	unit: cup
	name: a pinch salt and pepper 
	amount: n/a
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Prepare the sauce by whisking together the apricot preserves, dijon mustard, apple cider vinegar, garlic powder, and water. Set the sauce aside.
step 1:
Heat a large skillet with 2 Tbsp of olive oil over medium high heat. While the skillet is heating, remove the pork chops from their package and sprinkle salt and pepper on both sides.
step 2:
Once the skillet is very hot but not smoking (the oil should look wavy on the surface), add the chops to the skillet. Over crowding the skillet will cause the heat to drop and prevent searing so cook the chops in batches of two. Cook on each side until browned (about 5 minutes each side). NOTE: The chops will stick to the pan initially, but they will naturally be released from the surface when a “sear” has been achieved. If the chop is still sticking to the pan that means it is not ready to flip yet.
step 3:
When the chops finish searing, remove them to a clean plate and cover with foil to keep warm. Once all of the chops have cooked, reduce the heat to medium-low and pour the apricot sauce into the skillet. Using a whisk, stir and cook the sauce for 1-2 minutes. The whisk will help the pan drippings release from the bottom of the pan and flavor the sauce. This is called “deglazing.”
step 4:
Either serve the pork chops with the sauce spooned over top or add the chops back to the warm skillet to coat with sauce. I spooned the sauce over top for presentation’s sake but in the future I’ll probably add them to the pan to completely coat with the yummy sauce!

step 0:
Heat a large skillet over medium heat with 2 Tbsp of olive oil. Dice the onion and add it to the skillet along with the minced garlic. Cook over medium heat until the onions are soft and translucent (5-10 minutes).
step 1:
Once the onions are translucent, add the roasted tomatoes, tomato paste, and diced green chiles. Also stir in 1/2 cup of water, 3/4 tsp of salt, and 1/2 tsp of cumin. Stir everything together and allow it to come up to a simmer over medium heat.
step 2:
Make four indentations in the sauce with the back of a large spoon. Crack an egg into each. Reduce the heat to low, place a lid on top of the skillet and allow the mixture to simmer while you make the grits. It should take about 10 minutes of simmering on low with a lid for the eggs to poach.
step 3:
In a medium pot with a lid, bring 3 cups of water to a boil over high heat. Once it reaches a rolling boil, stir in the 3/4 cup of quick cooking grits and 3/4 tsp salt. Reduce the heat to low, place a lid on the pot, and allow it to cook on the lowest heat setting for 5 minutes. After five minutes it should be thick. Turn off the heat and stir in the butter. Place the lid back on the pot to keep them warm until you’re ready to serve.
step 4:
Once the eggs are done cooking, spoon some grits into a bowl and top with an egg and a spoonful or two of the tomato sauce. Add sliced fresh green onions on top.

	name: Panko breadcrumbs 
	amount: 2
	unit: cups
step 0:
In a bowl, combine the mayonnaise, mustard, honey, garlic powder, paprika, and some freshly ground black pepper. Stir until everything is evenly combined then taste and season with salt to your liking. Divide the sauce into two portions. Half will be the marinade and half will be the dipping sauce – it MUST stay separate. Keep the sauce refrigerated until ready to use.
step 1:
Trim the chicken breasts of excess fat and slice diagonally into 1/2 inch thick strips. You should get about 14-16 strips total. Place the sliced chicken in a bag or bowl with half of the honey mustard sauce and stir to coat. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or over night.
step 2:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Prepare a dredging station by lining a large baking sheet with foil and then placing two wire cooling racks on top. The wire racks keep the strips lifted as they bake so that the bottoms will crisp too. Coat the wire racks with non-stick spray. Pour the panko crumbs into a wide, shallow bowl.
step 3:
One by one, coat the chicken strips with panko crumbs. Do not wipe off excess honey mustard sauce before coating with panko, the sauce helps it adhere. Place the strips on the wire rack as you bread them. Continue until all of the strips are coated with panko crumbs. Discard the leftover honey mustard sauce that the chicken was marinating in.
step 4:
Bake the chicken strips in the oven until the crumbs have turned golden brown (about 30 minutes). To Fry: Alternatively, heat about 1/2 inch of vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until the surface of the oil looks wavy. Fry a few strips at a time on each side until they are golden brown and crispy. Drain on a plate covered with paper towels.
step 5:
Serve warm with the reserved half of the honey mustard sauce.

step 0:
Prepare and knead the pizza dough. Place the ball of dough in a bowl, loosely covered, in a warm place to rise for one hour.
step 1:
While the pizza dough is rising, make the hummus. Add enough liquid to the hummus so that it is easily spreadable with a spoon. Keep the hummus refrigerated until ready to use.
step 2:
Wash the vegetables to remove debris. Slice the squash and onion into half inch thick pieces. Place the squash in a bowl and drizzle with 2 Tbsp of olive oil. Season with salt and pepper and toss to coat. Preheat a counter top grill and then grill the squash for about 5 minutes. Wipe excess oil out of the bowl the portabello cap and onion pieces. Grill them in the same manner as the squash. After the vegetables are grilled, cut into bite sized pieces. Also, cut one of the roasted red peppers from the jar into strips.
step 3:
Once the dough has risen to about double its original size (about one hour), begin to preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Prepare a pizza pan with non-stick spray and a generous sprinkle of cornmeal.
step 4:
Punch the dough down and, using floured hands, stretch it into a 16 inch circle. Using the back of a spoon, spread about half of the batch of hummus over top of the dough. Top with the grilled vegetables.
step 5:
Bake the pizza for 20-25 minutes or until the outside edges of the crust are golden brown. Cut into 8 pieces and enjoy!

Turn the coated florets out onto a baking sheet (covered with foil for easy clean up) and spread into a single layer. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Bake in the 400 degree oven for 45 minutes, giving them a quick stir every 15 minutes. Before the final 15 minutes of cooking, sprinkle the last 2 Tbsp of parmesan over top.
step 3:
While the cauliflower is roasting in the oven, rinse the parsley, shake dry and then roughly chop. Sprinkle the parsley over the cauliflower after it finishes roasting.

	amount: n/a
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil. Cook the pasta according to the package directions.
step 1:
While the pasta is cooking, heat the olive oil and garlic in a skillet that is large enough to hold the cooked pasta. Cook the garlic over medium heat for 1-2 minutes or until it becomes very fragrant. Add the crushed red pepper and cook for 1-2 minutes more (do not let the red pepper burn, turn the heat down if it begins to brown).
step 2:
Very carefully, add 1-2 ladles of the pasta cooking water to the skillet. Also add about 1/4 bunch of chopped parsley. Let this simmer over medium heat until the pasta is done cooking.
step 3:
When the pasta is al dente, drain it briefly in a colander and then add it to the skillet. Stir everything together. Season with salt and freshly ground pepper to taste. If there is still liquid in the skillet, continue to let it simmer until it has evaporated (this shouldn’t take long).
step 4:
Drain the can of tuna and gently stir it into the pasta. Add a little more fresh chopped parsley, red pepper, or salt and pepper if desired. Serve hot.

step 0:
Lightly spray a large plate with non-stick spray. Place the tortilla on top and give it a light spray as well. Sprinkle on your seasoning.
step 1:
Microwave on high for one minute. Carefully flip the tortilla (it will be hot) and microwave again for one minute. Carefully flip again (the plate gets SUPER HOT) and microwave in increments of 30 seconds until crispy. NOTE: Sometimes it takes 5-10 seconds after it comes out of the microwave for it to fully crisp because the steam is still evaporating. My first tortilla only took 2.5 minutes, my second tortilla took 3 minutes. Both felt just slightly soft/damp when taking them out of the microwave but got completely crispy after just sitting there a few seconds.
step 2:
Break the tortilla up and enjoy!

step 1:
Dice the onion, carrot, and celery. Mince the garlic. Place all four in the bottom of the slow cooker. Nestle two ham hocks down into the vegetables.
step 2:
Pour the soaking water off of the beans and rinse again. Pour the drained beans into the slow cooker on top of the vegetables and ham hocks. Add the seasoning (2 bay leaves, 1 tsp thyme, 1 tsp oregano, 1.5 Tbsp chicken base and a few cranks of black pepper). Add 6 cups of water, give everything a light stir to distribute the seasoning a bit but don’t disturb the vegetables or ham hocks.
step 3:
Secure the lid on top of the slow cooker and cook on high for 4-6 hours or until the beans are soft and have absorbed most of the water.
step 4:
Stir the soup and remove the ham hocks. Pick any meat off of the ham hocks and return it to the soup. Taste the soup and adjust the seasoning to your liking (salt, pepper, hot sauce, Tony Chachere’s, smoked paprika? Anything you want). Serve hot with any garnishes you like (sour cream, cheese, green onions, crusty bread… get creative!)

	name: Italian seasoning 
	amount: 1
	unit: Tbsp
	name: corn meal 
	amount: 2
	unit: Tbsp
step 0:
The night before, combine the flour, salt and yeast in a large pot or bowl. Stir until everything is evenly combined and then stir in the water. The result should be one cohesive, sticky, shaggy lump of dough. If there is still dry flour in the pot or everything isn’t sticking together, add a little water at a time until it forms one ball. Loosely cover and let sit at room temperature until the next day (about 14 hours).
step 1:
The next day the dough will be wet, fluffy and may even be bubbling from the fermentation. Using a spatula, scrape the dough from the sides of the pot or bowl and turn it in on itself a few times until it forms a ball in the center of the pot.
step 2:
Prepare a baking sheet with foil, non-stick spray and a generous sprinkle of corn meal. Dust your hands with flour and sprinkle a little on top of the dough to keep it from sticking to your hands. Transfer the dough to the baking sheet. Stretch and pat the dough out into a large rectangle. You may need to dust your hands with flour throughout this process to keep the dough from sticking. It will be very wet and sticky.
step 3:
Drizzle olive oil over the surface of the dough and use a soft brush to spread it evenly over the surface. Sprinkle the Italian seasoning (or any type of herbs) over top. Let the dough rise for another hour.
step 4:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Using your fingers, press dimples into the risen dough (see photos). Bake the focaccia for 20-25 minutes in the preheated oven or until the surface is golden brown. After removing from the oven, transfer the focaccia to a wire rack to cool.

	name: pasta 
	amount: 8
	unit: oz.
	name: lg. chicken breasts 
	amount: 2
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Season the chicken breasts on both sides with salt and pepper (or any other seasoning you like). Cook on a George Foreman Grill about 8 minutes per breast. Alternatively, you can cook them in a non-stick skillet over medium-high heat for about 5 minutes per side or until cooked through. Keep the chicken on a plate covered with foil until ready to eat.
step 1:
While the chicken is cooking, prepare the sauce. Cut the onion into a small dice and mince the garlic. Cook them in a large skillet over medium heat with olive oil. Cook about two minutes or until the onion is transparent. Add the sliced mushrooms and a dash of salt and cook until the mushrooms have completely softened and released all of their moisture (about 7 minutes).
step 2:
Add the 2 Tbsp of flour to the skillet. Stir and cook for about 2 minutes. It will coat the mushrooms and will begin to turn golden in color. Just make sure to keep stirring so that the flour does not burn.
step 3:
Combine the chicken base and water to make a chicken broth. Add it to the skillet along with the white wine and thyme. Whisk until no flour lumps remain. Let simmer until thickened (about 3-5 minutes).
step 4:
While the sauce is simmering, get a large pot of water boiling for the pasta. Cook the pasta according to the directions on the box (boil for 5-7 minutes or until al dente then drain).
step 5:
Once the sauce has thickened, turn off the heat and stir in the cream. Continue to let simmer until reduced in volume and thickened. Give the sauce a taste and season with salt and pepper.
step 6:
Roughly chop the parsley and stir it in with the drained pasta. Grate about 2 ounces of parmesan over top (or top each serving individually). Slice the chicken and serve each bowl of pasta with a few slices of chicken.

step 0:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Peel and grate about 1 inch of ginger. Mince the clove of garlic. Combine both in a bowl with the brown sugar, soy sauce and sesame oil. Stir it up until the sugar dissolves and you have a thick, sticky mixture.
step 1:
Cut the salmon into three ounce portions (doesn’t have to be exact). Prepare a baking sheet with foil for easy clean up. If your salmon still has the skin attached, you do not need to spray the foil with non-stick spray. If there is no skin, give it some non-stick spray so that half of the salmon doesn’t get stuck to the foil.
step 2:
Slater the salmon with the brown sugar and ginger mixture, trying to keep as much on top as possible. Bake the salmon for 20-25 minutes or until the sugar mixture on top is golden brown. Serve immediately.

	unit: oz.
	name: sliced green onions, optional
	amount: 2
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Prepare the sauce first. Peel and grate one inch of ginger into a bowl. Add the peanut butter, hoisin sauce and sriracha hot sauce, and 1/3 cup of hot water. Stir or whisk until smooth. Set the sauce aside until it is needed.
step 1:
Prepare a very large skillet or wok with 2 Tbsp of vegetable oil. Grate another inch of ginger into the oil. Mince two cloves of garlic and add to the oil as well. Turn the heat up to medium high and saute for 1-2 minutes.
step 2:
Add the bag of frozen vegetables and cook until heated through. Use as large of a skillet as possible so that the residual moisture from the vegetables will evaporate quickly. Over crowding the skillet will leave you with a soupy mess. Frozen vegetables are blanched prior to freezing so they will already be slightly cooked and soft. Stir fry vegetables should still have a slight crunch and vibrant color. Do not cook them until they are very soft and dull in color.
step 3:
While the vegetables are cooking, bring a medium pot of water up to a rolling boil. Add the soba noodles and cook until soft (5-6 minutes). Drain the noodles in a colander.
step 4:
Once the vegetables have cooked, add the drained noodles and peanut sauce. Stir until everything is combined and coated with sauce. Garnish with sliced green onions if desired.

step 0:
Peel and cut the carrots and turnip into a small dice (about 1/4 – 1/2 inch square). Cook the carrot and turnip over medium heat in a large pot with 2 Tbsp of olive oil until the turnip begins to turn slightly transparent (2-3 minutes).
step 1:
While the carrot and turnip are cooking, Cut the onion into a small dice. Add the onion, ground cloves and garlic to the pot. Continue cooking and stirring until the onions have become transparent (about 5 minutes).
step 2:
While the vegetables are cooking, measure out your lentils and pick through to make sure there are no stones or debris. Add the lentils and water to the pot. Place a lid on top and bring up to a boil. Let the pot boil until the lentils are soft which should take approximately 20 minutes. To check for doneness, take a few lentils out of the pot with a fork and taste. They should have a soft, bean like texture.
step 3:
When the lentils are done, drain them in a colander. Return the lentils to the pot (burner turned OFF) and add 1 Tbsp of butter. Stir in the butter to melt and let the lentils cool while you prepare the dressing.
step 4:
In a large bowl, whisk together the dijon, red wine vinegar, salt and freshly cracked pepper. Rinse and shake dry a half bunch of parsley. Roughly chop the parsley.
step 5:
Pour the still slightly warm lentils into the bowl with the dressing and toss to coat. Add the parsley and stir until everything is evenly mixed. Serve warm or refrigerate and serve cold!

Refill the zucchini halves with the prepared mixture. Top with mozzarella cheese and black olives. Place in the oven and bake for approximately 20 minutes or until the cheese has melted and is slightly browned. The longer the zucchini are in the oven, the softer they’ll be so if you like firmer zucchini, bake for a shorter amount of time.

	amount: 1
	unit: cup
	name: powdered sugar 
	amount: 1
	unit: cup
step 0:
Preheat your oven to 350 degrees. In a large bowl, combine the flour, granulated sugar, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, salt, cloves and lemon zest. Stir until everything is well combined.
step 1:
Make two wells in the dry ingredients and place the cider vinegar in one and shortening,oil or butter in the other (melt the shortening or butter first). Pour the water over everything and stir just until everything is wet. There may still be lumps but that is okay, just make sure there are no large pockets of dry stuff on the bottom.
step 2:
Pour the batter into a loaf pan or 8×8 baking dish that has been sprayed with non-stick spray. Cook for 30-40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean. The batter will be more shallow in a square baking dish and will therefore cook faster than in a loaf pan. Keep an eye on the top, if it starts to crack, it is probably done. Let cool on a wire rack.
step 3:
While the cake is cooling, make the lemon glaze. Place the powdered sugar in a small bowl and stir in the juice from the lemon. Depending on how much juice is in your lemon, you may not need all of it. Wait until the cake has cooled before pouring on the glaze or else the heat will cause the glaze to slide right off.

	unit: n/a
step 0:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Peel and wash the carrots. Cut off the ends and then slice into two inch segments. For the thicker ends, also cut lengthwise into two or four sticks. Attempt to make the segments similar in length and thickness so they will cook at the same rate.
step 1:
Place the carrots on a baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil. Sprinkle on a little salt and pepper and then toss to coat. Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven.
step 2:
Let the carrots roast in the oven for about 45 minutes. Stir once half way through to redistribute the oil. While the carrots are roasting, rinse the parsley, shake dry and roughly chop.
step 3:
After the carrots are finished roasting, they will be softened, the surface will be slightly blistered and some may have brown edges. Let the carrots cool just slightly. Place the carrots in a bowl with the chopped parsley and crumbled feta. Toss everything to mix and serve warm.

Cut the ribs into two rib portions. Season with salt and pepper.
step 2:
Arrange half of the ribs in on top of the onion in the slow cooker. Cover with half of the BBQ sauce. Place the rest of the ribs on top and cover with the rest of the BBQ sauce. Pour the apple sauce and water (or whatever liquid you are using) in around the edges of the ribs so it fills in the spaces between meat without washing off all of the BBQ sauce.
step 3:
Secure the lid tightly on the slow cooker, turn on low heat and let cook for 8 hours. When the ribs are done, carefully remove them from the pot. They will be very tender and can fall apart easily so lift gently. Fish out the onions and serve on top of the ribs.

step 2:
Loosely cover the bowl and let sit at room temperature for two hours.
step 3:
After two hours, sprinkle a little flour on the dough and your hands and form the dough into a smooth ball. Prepare a baking sheet with either parchment paper or foil and a generous sprinkle of cornmeal. Place shaped dough ball on the baking sheet and let rise for 1 to 1.5 hours or until double in size.
step 4:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. With a very sharp knife, make a few shallow slashes across the dough from one side to the other. Brush the dough with water and then bake for 30 minutes. Let the bread cool on a wire rack before slicing.

step 0:
Dice the onion and mince the garlic. Place them in a large pot with 3 Tbsp of olive oil and cook over medium heat until softened (about 5 minutes).
step 1:
While the onion and garlic are cooking, wash the eggplant and cut into 1/2 to 3/4 inch cubes. Add the eggplant cubes to the pot with the onion and garlic and continue cooking. Add a pinch of salt to help the moisture come out of the eggplant.
step 2:
Wash and dice the yellow bell pepper and green bell pepper. Add to the pot with the other vegetables and continue cooking until all of the vegetables have begun to soften (5-10 minutes).
step 3:
Add the fire roasted tomatoes, tomato paste, vinegar, sugar, water, basil, crushed red pepper and capers to the pot. Give everything a good stir. Taste the mixture and add more salt and pepper as needed (I added about 1/2 tsp of salt). Let the mixture simmer over low heat for about 15 minutes to further break down the vegetables.
step 4:
While the mixture simmers, cook the pasta according to the directions on the box (boil for 7-10 minutes). Drain the cooked pasta in a colander.
step 5:
Roughly chop about 1/4 bunch of parsley. When the caponata is finished cooking, turn off the heat and stir in the fresh parsley. Add the cooked pasta and stir to combine. Serve hot.

Prepare the sauce by combining the hoisin sauce, peanut butter, sriracha and grated ginger. Add 1/4 cup of hot water and whisk the ingredients together. Continue to add hot water until the sauce is the consistency you desire. I used 1/4 cup plus two more tablespoons of hot water.
step 1:
Gather and prepare the filling ingredients. Slice the red bell pepper and mango, soak the bean threads, chop the lettuce and pull the cilantro leaves from the stems.
step 2:
When your fillings are ready to go, take one rice paper wrapper at a time and soak it in warm water for five seconds or until it is soft and limp like a wet paper towel. Lay the soft wrapper on a clean surface, place the fillings on top near one side and then roll the wrapper around them. Fold the left and right sides in as you roll to close up the ends. Here is an excellent video of how to roll them.
step 3:
Serve with the dipping sauce on the side!

step 0:
Bring a pot of lightly salted water up to a boil. Add the pasta and cook according to the package directions (boil for 7-10 minutes or until al dente). Remove one cup of peas from the freezer so they can begin to thaw.
step 1:
While the pasta is boiling, begin to make the sauce. In a large bowl, combine the ricotta, butter, salt (about 1/2 tsp), freshly ground pepper (about 20 cranks of a pepper mill) and the juice and zest of one lemon. When the pasta is almost finished boiling, take 1/3 cup of the hot, starchy pasta water and whisk it into the other ingredients to create a smooth sauce. Adjust the salt and pepper as needed.
step 2:
Place the peas in a colander and pour the boiling pasta over them to drain (this speeds up the thawing process). When the pasta has drained and is still hot, stir the pasta and peas into the ricotta cheese sauce. Serve hot or cold.

Peel the ginger and slice into medallions. Remove any dry or black layers of the lemongrass and cut into 1 inch sections. Wash the lime well to remove any waxes or residues and remove the peel with a vegetable peeler. Try to get as little of the white pith as possible on the lime peel.
step 1:
Place the ginger, lemongrass, lime peel, both cans of coconut milk, chicken bouillon and water in a pot. Place over medium heat and stir to combine the ingredients and dissolve the coconut milk solids. Bring the liquid to a simmer.
step 2:
While the soup is coming up to a liquid, thinly slice the chicken. Once the broth reaches a simmer, add the chicken, allow it to come back up to a simmer and let it cook for about ten minutes or until the chicken is fully cooked.
step 3:
Once the chicken is fully cooked, turn off the burner. Add the juice from the lime and the fish sauce. Serve hot with a few sprigs of fresh cilantro. Serve over hot jasmine rice if desired.

	amount: n/a
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Bring a large pot of water to a boil for the pasta. Once boiling, add the pasta and continue to boil until the pasta is tender. Drain the pasta in a colander and set it aside until ready to use.
step 1:
Meanwhile, allow the broccoli to thaw. Once partially thawed, chop the florets into smaller, bite-sized pieces, and set them aside to fully thaw while you prepare the rest of the dish.
step 2:
While the pasta is cooking, begin the cheese sauce. Finely dice the onion and add it to a sauce pot with the butter. Cook the onion and butter over medium heat until the onions are softened (about 2-3 minutes).
step 3:
Add the flour to the butter and onion. The flour and butter will form a paste, or roux. Whisk the roux over medium heat for 1-2 minutes more taking care not to let it scorch. This slightly cooks the flour preventing the cheese sauce from having an overly flour or paste-like flavor.
step 4:
Whisk the milk into the roux until no lumps remain. Add some freshly cracked pepper to the sauce. Bring the mixture up to a simmer, stirring often (you may need to raise the heat just slightly). When the sauce reaches a simmer, it will begin to thicken. When it is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, it’s time to add the cheese.
step 5:
Turn the burner off and whisk in the shredded cheddar, one handful at a time, until it is fully melted in. Next, stir in the grated Parmesan. Give the cheese sauce a taste and add salt, pepper, and hot sauce to taste.
step 6:
Once you have the cheese sauce seasoned to your liking, return the drained pasta to its large pot, add the chopped broccoli, and pour the cheese sauce over top. Stir until everything is combined and coated in the wonderfully cheesy sauce. Serve hot.

	unit: n/a
	name: chicken thighs (8 pieces)
	amount: 4
	unit: lbs
step 0:
Finely dice the onion and garlic. Cook both in a sauce pan with vegetable oil over medium heat until softened (3-5 minutes). Meanwhile, roughly chop one chipotle pepper and reserve 1 Tbsp of adobo sauce from the can.
step 1:
Add the tomato sauce, raspberry jam, cider vinegar, chopped chipotle pepper and adobo sauce to the cooked onions and garlic. Stir everything well and bring up to a simmer. Continue to simmer for about 45 minutes, stirring occasionally. Allow the sauce to cool after simmering (it will thicken upon cooling).
step 2:
Remove the skin from the chicken and trim any excess fat. The skin should pull away from the meat easily although you may need a small sharp knife to separate it in some places. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
step 3:
Prepare a baking sheet with aluminum foil and non-stick spray. Place the chicken thighs on the tray and slather with BBQ sauce (pour a small amount of sauce into a bowl before brushing onto chicken so that the whole batch will not get contaminated with raw chicken).
step 4:
Place the BBQ chicken in the oven and bake for 45 minutes. Fifteen and thirty minutes into the cooking time, take the chicken out and slather with more sauce.

	amount: 1/4
	unit: cup
step 0:
Rinse the mangoes and cut into chunks. Set the mango chunks aside. For a video demonstration on how to cut a mango, click here.
step 1:
Dice the onion. In a medium pot, heat the vegetable oil and red pepper flakes. When the red pepper begins to leach color into the oil and the flakes darken slightly, add the onion and continue to cook until the onion softens.
step 2:
As the onion and red pepper are cooking, peel a two inch knob of ginger with a vegetable peeler. Using a cheese grater, grate the peeled ginger straight into the pot with the onion and red pepper. Continue to cook until the onion has softened.
step 3:
Add the mango chunks and canned pineapple (with juice) to the pot. Also add the brown sugar, vinegar and garam masala. Stir the mixture well and bring up to a simmer.
step 4:
Let the mix simmer heavily for one hour. Stir the pot occasionally. As the chutney simmers, the fruit will break down and the liquid will thicken until finally you will have a more jam like consistency. If using raisins, add them toward the end of the cooking time (about 45 minutes in). Serve hot or cold.

Give everything a stir and continue to simmer until the sauce has reduced to a thick consistency (about 20 minutes total). Stir the pot every few minutes to prevent the sauce from burning and sticking to the bottom.

step 2:
After marinating, place the chicken strips on skewers and grill (I put two chicken strips per skewer). If using a George Foreman grill, preheat the grill for five minutes. Place the kebabs on the grill and cook for three minutes. Flip the kebabs and cook for three minutes more to achieve grill marks on both sides.

	name: flour, divided
	amount: 2
	unit: Tbsp
step 0:
Divide 1 tsp of butter between two four-inch (8 oz.) ramekins. Using your fingers, smear the butter all over the inside surface of the ramekins until they are coated. Tbsp of flour inside one ramekin and roll it around until the entire inside is dusted with flour. Pour the excess flour into the second ramekin and dust in the same manner. Discard the excess flour from the second ramekin.
step 1:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. In a small bowl combine the egg, egg yolk and white sugar. Using a mixer, whip the mixture until it is aerated and a light yellow color (about 2 minutes).
step 2:
In a small microwave safe bowl, combine the chocolate and butter. Microwave for 15 second intervals, stirring well between each interval. The chocolate will melt further as you stir between heating so stir well. My chocolate took 3, 15 second intervals (45 seconds total) to melt completely.
step 3:
Stir the remaining 1 Tbsp of flour and the melted butter/chocolate mixture into the whipped eggs and sugar. You can use the mixer again if desired but I just stirred really well with a fork.
step 4:
Divide the cake batter between the two ramekins. Place the ramekins on a baking sheet and place in the oven. Cook for 8-10 minutes. Keep a close eye on the cakes, you want to remove them from the oven when the edges are set but the centers are still soft and jiggly.

step 0:
Rinse the parsley and remove as much water as possible by shaking into the sink (hold onto the stems). Pull the leaves from the stems and place them in the food chopper or processor. Cut the lemon in half and add the juice and zest from one half into the food chopper. Save the other half of the lemon for garnish. Also add the garlic, olive oil, salt and pepper. Turn the chopper on until the parsley and garlic are finely minced and the mixture is well combined.
step 1:
Place the fish fillets (thawed) to a bowl or shallow dish and pour the lemon-garlic-parsley mix over top. Make sure both sides are covered. Some may run off but that is okay. Spray the grill surface with non-stick spray and preheat for 5 minutes.
step 2:
Place the fish fillets in the hot grill, close the lid and set the timer for 2 minutes. Check the fish after two minutes. If you want the fish more browned, cook for one additional minute. Carefully remove the fish from the grill (it will be delicate). Serve with additional slices of lemon if desired.

	amount: n/a
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Start by dicing the onion and mincing the garlic. Cook them both in a small skillet with 1 Tbsp of vegetable oil over medium heat until they are soft and transparent.
step 1:
While the onions and garlic are cooking, prepare the rest of the meatball mix. Squeeze the turkey sausage out of its casing into a large bowl. Rinse and shake dry about 1/4 bunch of parsley. Remove the leaves from the stem and roughly chop. Add the chopped parsley to the sausage along with the bread crumbs, parmesan cheese, egg white, sriracha sauce, worchestershire sauce, red pepper flakes and cracked black pepper (about 20 cranks of the pepper mill). When the onions and garlic are soft, add them as well. Use your hands to mix the ingredients together until it is an even, homogeneous mixture.
step 2:
Using your hands, form the meatball mixture into small balls (about 1 Tbsp) and line them up on a clean surface. You should be able to make about 56 small, 1 tablespoon sized meatballs. Once all of the balls are shaped, place 1/2 cup of all purpose flour in a bowl and coat each meatball in the flour.
step 3:
Heat about 2 Tbsp of vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. When the oil is very hot (but not smoking) add about half of the meatballs. Let them brown on one side then carefully roll to another side and let brown. Continue to cook and roll the meatballs around until they are deep brown and crispy on most sides (they won’t be perfect spheres). If necessary, break a meatball open to make sure it is cooked all the way through before removing from the pan.
step 4:
Transfer the cooked meatballs to a plate covered with paper towel to drain. If necessary, add another tablespoon of vegetable oil to the pan before cooking the second batch.

step 0:
Chop the onion and mince the garlic. Cook both in a large pot with olive oil over medium heat until softened.
step 1:
If you are using fresh collard greens, they will need to be washed, stems removed and cut into 2 inch pieces. I used pre-washed and chopped, bagged collard greens (the fresh bunches didn’t look so hot that day).
step 2:
Add the beer, bouillon cube, water, collard greens, brown sugar, red pepper flakes and black pepper to the pot. Place a lid on top and allow the pot to come to a boil.
step 3:
Once the pot begins to boil, the collards will have wilted enough to give it all a stir without everything spilling out. Stir everything up good then place the lid back on top, reduce the heat to low and let simmer until the collards are to the desired tenderness (I simmered for two hours). Stir every 15 minutes or so.

step 0:
Cut/tear the bread into one inch cubes. Spread them out on a baking sheet and place in a 300 degree oven until dry (about 15 minutes). Mix them around about half way through.
step 1:
While the bread is drying out, mix together the custard. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the cream, milk, eggs, brown sugar, white sugar, vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg. Whisk very well. Roughly chop the walnuts.
step 2:
Coat a glass baking dish with non-stick spray. Place the dry bread cubes in the dish and sprinkle the walnuts over top. Slowly pour in the custard mix, trying to get some on all of the bread. Give it a gentle stir, cover with plastic and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow the bread to soak up the liquid.
step 3:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Take the bread pudding out of the refrigerator, give it a gentle stir and then place in the hot oven. Bake for 60 minutes.
step 4:
Near the end of the baking time, prepare the rum sauce. Place all of the ingredients (butter, sugar, cream and rum) in a small sauce pan. Cook over medium heat while stirring until the sugar is completely dissolved and the butter has melted completely. When the bread pudding comes out of the oven, drizzle the rum sauce over top. The butter will separate out of the sauce as it sits so stir just prior to drizzling over top.

	name: nutmeg 
	amount: 1/8
	unit: tsp
	name: chicken broth
	amount: 1
	unit: cup
step 0:
Heat the vegetable oil in a heavy skillet over medium heat. While the skillet is heating, open the pork chops and season each side with a pinch of salt and freshly ground pepper.
step 1:
Once the oil is hot and shimmering, place the chops in the pan. Cook the chops undisturbed for 5-7 minutes or until the bottoms form a nice brown crust. If your chops are sticking to the pan, that means they have not formed a crust yet. They will “let go” once the crust forms. Flip the chops and cook the second side in the same manner. It should take 5-7 minutes for each side.
step 2:
While the chops are searing, thinly slice the onion and slice the apples into wedges. Once the chops have browned on both sides, remove them to a clean plate (they do not need to be cooked through at this point). Add the apples, onions, and butter to the skillet and sauté until the onions are softened. Allow the moisture from the apples and onions to dissolve the browned bits from the skillet as they cook.
step 3:
Add the broth, brown sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg to the skillet with the apples and onions. Stir until everything is combined, then return the chops to the pan, along with any juices that may have collected on the plate. Nestle the chops down in the mixture, making sure some onions and apples are on top of the chops.
step 4:
Simmer the chops in the apple and onion mixture for about 10 minutes, or until the liquid has reduced by half, the apples are soft, and the pork chops are cooked through. Stir occasionally, moving the apples and onions around so they all have a chance to simmer and soften. Serve each chop with apples, onions and sauce spooned over top.

	name: cinnamon
	amount: 1
	unit: Tbsp
	name: warm water
	amount: 1 1/4
	unit: cups
step 0:
In a large pot or bowl, combine the flours, brown sugar, salt, yeast and raisins. Stir everything until evenly mixed (break up any raisin clumps).
step 1:
Add the warm water and stir. If the dough does not come into one cohesive ball (with no dry bits left at the bottom of the bowl) add a little more water, one tablespoon at a time, until it all comes together (see photos below). Loosely cover the bowl and let it rest for 2 hours at room temperature.
step 2:
After two hours the dough will have risen and grown to about twice the size. It will be a rough looking, shaggy ball of dough. Turn it out onto a floured surface. Give it maybe one or two turns or “kneads” in the flour just to work in enough flour to keep it from sticking to your hands. Flatten and stretch the dough into a long rectangle. The short side of the rectangle should be the same length as your bread pan, the long side double that.
step 3:
Sprinkle the cinnamon over the surface of the rectangle. If you want a sweeter bread, you can sprinkle on some additional brown sugar with the cinnamon. Roll the rectangle up and place it in a bread pan coated with non-stick spray. Let the bread rise for 1.5 hours or until it has risen up and out of the pan.
step 4:
Preheat your oven to 425 degrees. Brush the top of the bread with water and bake for approximately 30 minutes or until the top is a deep golden brown. After baking, turn it out of the bread pan onto a wire cooling rack. Let cool completely before slicing.

	amount: 1/2
	unit: cup
step 0:
Wash the zucchini and cut the ends off. Using the large holes on a cheese grater, grate the zucchini. You will need about 2 cups total which was 2 small zucchini or about .75 lbs.
step 1:
Combine the garlic, oregano, basil, salt and pepper in a bowl (start with 1/4 tsp of salt and about 10 cranks of the pepper mill). Stir to combine. Taste the zucchini and adjust the salt and pepper to your liking. It should be stronger than you want the finished product to be because once you add the flour and egg, the flavor and saltiness will be diluted.
step 2:
Whisk an egg and add it to the zucchini along with 3/4 cups of flour. Stir until everything is evenly combined. The texture should be similar to cake batter.
step 3:
Heat 1/2 cup oil in a small skillet until very hot. To test the temperature, drop a SMALL piece of the batter into the oil, it should bubble heavily. The oil should not be smoking, if it is, lower the heat immediately. Drop the batter into the oil, one spoonful at a time. Fry the fritters on each side until deep golden brown. Let the fritters drain on a paper towel covered plate.

	amount: n/a
	unit: n/a

	amount: n/a
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Get a large pot of water boiling with a dash of salt. When it comes to a full boil, add the lasagna noodles and cook until al dente (soft but not soggy… about 12-15 minutes). When they are finished cooking, drain in a colander.
step 1:
While the noodles are boiling, prepare the filling. Thaw the package of frozen spinach in the microwave and then squeeze out as much excess liquid as possible. Combine the spinach in a bowl with the ricotta, mozzarella, parmesan, egg, freshly grated pepper and about 1/4 tsp of salt. Mix until well combined.
step 2:
When the noodles and filling are ready to go, preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Prepare a glass casserole dish by spraying with non-stick spray.
step 3:
On a clean surface, lay out a few noodles at a time. Place a few tablespoons of filling on each noodle and spread to cover from edge to edge. The filling does not need to be thick because once the noodle is rolled up, it will be compounded. Make sure to spread it all the way to the edges of the noodles.
step 4:
Roll the noodles up and place in the prepared casserole dish. Repeat until all of your filling is gone (there may be some noodles left over, these are “back ups” in case any of the others rip during assembly). Pour the marinara sauce over the rolled noodles making sure to cover all surfaces. The sauce will keep the noodles hydrated and soft while baking.
step 5:
Cover the dish in foil and bake for 30 minutes. Serve hot or divide into individual portions and refrigerate.

	amount: 2 1/4
	unit: cups
step 0:
Trim the fat from the chicken breasts and cut them into small chunks. Set chicken aside. Dice the onion and mince the garlic and ginger.
step 1:
In a large pot, melt the butter over medium/high heat. When the butter is nice and hot (careful not to burn it) add the chicken chunks and brown them on all sides. Remove the chicken from the pot and set aside. It’s okay if it isn’t cooked through because it will simmer in the sauce later.
step 2:
Reduce the heat to medium and add the onions, garlic and ginger. Saute the mix for 2-3 minutes or until they begin to soften. Add the garam masala and cayenne pepper. Continue to cook and stir for 2 minutes more.
step 3:
Add the tomato sauce and diced tomatoes. Stir until everything is evenly combined. Add the chicken back in, place a lid on top and reduce the heat to medium-low. Allow the mixture to simmer for one hour or until the chicken is tender and cooked through.
step 4:
While the pot is simmering, begin to cook the rice. Combine 1.5 cups of rice and 2.25 cups of water in a medium pot. Place a lid on top and heat over a high flame until boiling. Once it comes to a full boil, immediately reduce the heat to low and let simmer for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, turn the heat off and keep the lid in place until ready to serve.
step 5:
After the chicken and tomato mixture has simmered, break the chicken into smaller pieces if desired (the chicken should be soft and easily broken apart). Stir in the plain yogurt. Serve the chicken mixture over a bed of rice. Garnish with cilantro if desired.

	unit: oz.
step 0:
Crack six eggs into a bowl and whisk slightly. Heat a medium skillet with 1 Tbsp of butter over a medium flame. Once the skillet is hot, pour in the eggs. As the edges of the eggs begin to set, use a spatula to gently pull them in towards the center of the pan, allowing liquid egg to fill in the empty space left behind. Continue to do this until the eggs are mostly set but still glossy. Turn off the heat and season with salt, pepper and red pepper flakes. (you can cook the scrambled eggs however you’d like but this is how I cook them to prevent ending up with dry, pellet-like, over cooked scrambled eggs).
step 1:
Lay your tortillas out on a counter top. Divide the eggs among the six tortillas. Place the eggs just to one side of the center line of the tortilla (this will make rolling the burrito easier. See photos below for examples).
step 2:
Top the eggs with about 1/4 cup of beans, 1 Tbsp of salsa and 1 oz of cheese on each burrito. Roll the burritos up and set aside, seam side down.
step 3:
Place the burritos, seam side down, in a warm skillet until the tortilla is golden brown and crispy. Cook on all sides in the same manner. Allow the burritos to cool just slightly, wrap tightly with plastic wrap or parchment paper, label and freeze.

	name: whole wheat flour 
	amount: 1
	unit: cup
	name: all-purpose flour 
	amount: 1

	name: salt

	name: vegetable oil 
	amount: 2
	unit: tsp
	name: warm water 
	amount: 3/4
	unit: cup
step 0:
In a large bowl, combine the flour, salt and baking powder. Stir until evenly combined.
step 1:
Combine the warm water and vegetable oil then begin adding to the flour mixture a little at a time. Stir and add water/oil until the dough comes together into one piece. You may need more or less water depending on the moisture content of your flour (I ended up added an extra 2 Tbsp).
step 2:
Knead the dough for about a minute. Shape into a ball and let rest, covered with a damp towel for about 10 minutes. Divide the dough into 12 pieces and shape each piece into a ball. Let rest for another 10 minutes.
step 3:
Roll each piece of dough out into a 6 inch circle about the thickness of a piece of poster board. Stack the tortillas, dusted with flour, until they are all rolled out.
step 4:
Heat a heavy bottomed skillet over medium heat. One at a time, cook the tortillas in the hot skillet until blistered and slightly golden on each side. Stack the tortillas on a plate covered with a dry towel to keep them soft and warm until all of the tortillas have cooked.

	amount: 2
	unit: cups
	name: lard

	unit: Tbsp
	name: salt 
	amount: 3/4
	unit: tsp
	name: warm water 
	amount: 3/4
	unit: cup
step 0:
Combine the flours in a large bowl and stir until evenly mixed. Add the lard and work it in with your hands until the flour is coated in lard you have an even, crumbly mixture (looks like coarse sand).
step 1:
Dissolve the salt into the warm water. Add the salt water to the flour/lard a little at a time until a cohesive ball has formed. You may need more or less water depending on the moisture content of your flour.
step 2:
Once you have a rough ball of dough, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead it for a minute or two or just until everything is evenly mixed. The dough will be fairly stiff and quite unlike regular bread dough so don’t worry if it is difficult to knead.
step 3:
Divid the dough into 8 pieces (for large tortillas) or 12 (for smaller, 6-inch tortillas). Do your best to shape them into balls and let them sit for 30 minutes, covered with a damp towel.
step 4:
After the dough has rested it will be much softer and easier to roll out. Roll each ball into a very thin circle (about the thickness of poster board). You can pile the rolled tortillas, one on top of the other until you are finished rolling.
step 5:
Heat a heavy bottomed skillet over a medium flame. Once the pan is fully preheated, place one tortilla in at a time. Wait for it to bubble up and turn slightly golden then flip and cook the second side in the same manner (about 30 seconds each side). As each tortilla comes out of the skillet, pile them on a plate and cover with a damp cloth to keep soft and warm.

	amount: 6 oz
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Clean and chop the onion, carrot, celery and garlic. Cook in a large pot with olive oil over medium heat until the vegetables have softened (about 5 minutes). Stir in the basil and oregano and cook for one more minute.
step 1:
Pour in the cans of diced tomatoes (do not drain) and tomato sauce. For the diced tomatoes you can either use 3 (15 oz.) cans or 1 (28 oz.) can plus 1 (15 oz.) can. The latter will probably be less expensive.
step 2:
Add 1.5 cups chicken broth or 1.5 cups water plus 1.5 tsp chicken bouillon. To make this a vegetarian dish, simply substitute the chicken broth or bouillon with a vegetable variety. Add the tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, and the brick of frozen spinach. Allow the mixture to heat through, stirring occasionally to break up the spinach as it melts (about 10 minutes).
step 3:
Once the soup is completely heated through, dice the swiss cheese. Reduce the heat to low or turn the heat off completely. Drop in the swiss cheese and stir it in. The cheese will melt and become gooey but remain in clumps. If the heat is left on high, the cheese will melt too much and dissolve in. Alternatively, you can add the cheese to each bowl of soup after serving.

step 0:
Chop the onion and garlic and place it in the slow cooker with a couple tablespoons of olive oil.
step 1:
Dump the dry peas into a colander and sift through to remove any stones or bad peas. Rinse thoroughly with water then add to the slow cooker.
step 2:
Add 6 cups of chicken broth (or 6 cups of water and 2 Tbsp bouillon) to the slow cooker along with two bay leaves, 1/2 tsp of dried thyme, 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes and a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper.
step 3:
Place the lid on the slow cooker, turn the power on to High and let cook until the peas are soft. I let mine cook without checking them for three hours and they were perfectly cooked. They may have been done sooner but I didn’t have a chance to check. Black-eyed peas tend to cook faster than other beans.

step 0:
Bring a large pot of water to a boil and cook the pasta according to the package directions. Pasta is usually sold in 16 oz. boxes and bags, so you’ll need about 3/4 of the box (no need to actually weigh 12 oz.).
step 1:
While the water is coming to a boil, heat a large skillet with 2 Tbsp of olive oil over medium heat. While the pan is heating, mince the garlic then add to the pan. Cook the garlic just until softened and fragrant (about 1-2 minutes).
step 2:
Turn the heat on the skillet up to medium high and add the shrimp (thawed, drained). Saute the shrimp and garlic until the shrimp are fully cooked (about 5 minutes). They will be pink and no longer transparent when fully cooked.
step 3:
While the shrimp are cooking, rinse and slice all of the tomatoes in half. Once the shrimp is cooked, add the tomatoes. Season the pan with salt and pepper and continue to cook until the tomatoes start to break down just slightly (about 5 min).
step 4:
The pasta should be finished cooking at this point. Drain the pasta, add it to the skillet along with the jar of pesto. Stir until everything is evenly coated with pesto. Sprinkle with fresh parsley and serve!

	amount: 2
	unit: Tbsp
step 0:
In a large bowl or pot, combine the dry ingredients (flours, salt, yeast, cranberries and walnuts. Cornmeal not included). Add the water and stir until a shaggy ball forms.
step 1:
Let the dough sit at room temperature with a loose cover (I use the lid to the pot, slightly cocked so gasses can escape) for two hours. After two hours turn the dough out onto a floured surface and give it 3 or four turns (or kneads) just to make a coherent, smooth ball. Cut into two or leave as one large piece of dough. Shape into a round ball.
step 2:
Place the shaped dough onto a baking sheet covered with parchment paper and sprinkled with cornmeal. Let rise for at least one hour or until double in size. At the end of the rise, preheat the oven to 450 degrees.
step 3:
Using a sharp knife or a serrated bread knife, gently make a few slits across the top of the dough. Brush or spritz the dough with water and bake for about 30 minutes or until the crust is a deep golden brown. Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack.

step 0:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Rinse the vegetables (tomatoes, onion, garlic, bell pepper, poblano, jalapeno) and cut into large chunks. Place vegetables on a baking sheet, drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Toss the vegetables to coat. Roast the vegetables in the oven for about 45 minutes or until the skins are bubbled up and brown (see photos below).
step 1:
Remove the vegetables from the oven. Let them cool enough to handle then remove the skin and seeds from the poblanos and bell peppers. Place all of the roasted vegetables, any juice from the baking sheet and a handful of cilantro into a food processor or blender. Process until you have a fairly smooth, salsa-like consistency.
step 2:
Combine the pureed vegetables and the cooked beans in a large pot. Add 1 Tbsp of bouillion (vegetable or chicken) and 3 cups of water. Add the juice from one lime, cumin and salt to taste (I added 1 tsp of salt). Heat the mixture through (about 10-15 minutes).
step 3:
Transfer about 2/3 of the soup to the food processor or blender and process again until smooth. Add it back to the pot and stir it into the larger chunks that were left behind. Give the soup a final taste and adjust the seasoning as needed (salt, pepper, hot sauce, cumin, cayenne, whatever you like).

	name: cup warm water 
	amount: 1 1/8
	unit: n/a
	name: yeast 
	amount: 1 1/2
	unit: tsp
	name: sugar

	unit: cup
	name: all-purpose flour 
	amount: 2 1/2
	unit: cups
	name: salt 
	amount: 1
	unit: tsp
step 0:
In a small bowl combine the warm water, sugar and yeast. Stir to dissolve and let sit for 5 minutes or until a foam develops on top. Once a foam develops on top, add 1 Tbsp of olive oil.
step 1:
In a large bowl, combine 1 cup of flour (half whole wheat in my case) and the salt. Stir them so they are evenly combined. Add the small bowl of liquid to the bowl with the flour. Stir to combine.
step 2:
Continue mixing in flour until it forms a loose ball that you can no longer stir with a spoon. Turn the ball of dough out onto a floured surface and continue to knead in more flour until a soft and pliable (but not sticky) ball forms. You should have used around 3 cups of flour total and kneaded the dough for at least 3 minutes.
step 3:
Place the ball of dough in an oiled bowl, cover loosely and let sit to rise for one hour or until doubled in size.
step 4:
Punch down the risen dough and turn it out onto a floured surface. Stretch the dough into a log and cut it into 8 (or 6) equal sized pieces. Shape each piece of dough into a smooth ball and then roll it out into a flat, 6 inch diameter circle.
step 5:
Preheat the oven to 500 degrees and let the dough circles rest as the oven comes up to temp. Place a damp cloth over the dough circles so they do not dry out. When the oven is hot enough, place the dough circles on a wire rack (a couple at a time) and place the rack in the oven. Watch the circles puff up as they bake. When the circle has completely inflated but not yet turned brown you can remove it from the oven and put in the next batch. If you let the pitas cook until golden brown they will be crispier and may retain the inflated shape as they cool.
step 6:
As you remove the pitas from the oven, stack them on a plate and cover with a damp cloth. The trapped steam will soften them as they cool. Once completely cooled, store the pitas in an air tight container in the refrigerator.

step 0:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. In a large bowl combine the white sugar, brown sugar, eggs, vanilla, butter, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger and cloves. Mix until everything is evenly incorporated and it has a creamy texture (by hand or mixer).
step 1:
In a smaller bowl combine the flour, salt and baking powder. Stir them until they are evenly combined. Add the flour mixture to the bowl of wet ingredients and stir it until a soft dough forms.
step 2:
Using your hands (dust with flour if needed) shape the dough into two logs about 3 inches wide and 14 inches long. Bake in the oven for 35 minutes or until golden brown.
step 3:
Remove the logs from the oven and carefully transfer to a cutting board. Using a serrated knife, gently slice the logs diagonally into 1 inch thick pieces (see photos below).
step 4:
Place the slices back on the baking sheet. Sprinkle the tops with a mixture of cinnamon and sugar and bake for 5-7 minutes. Flip the pieces over, sprinkle the other side with cinnamon and sugar and bake for another 5-7 minutes. Let the biscotti cool on a wire rack before packaging or storing in an air tight container.

	name: cornmeal
	amount: 2
	unit: Tbsp
step 0:
In a large bowl combine the flour, salt, and yeast. Stir the dry ingredients well until they are evenly combined. Add the water and stir it until a wet, sticky ball of dough forms and no flour remains on the bottom of the bowl. Loosely cover and let sit at room temperature for 14-18 hours to ferment.
step 1:
After fermentation, the dough should be wet, sticky, very bubbly, and fluffy. Dust the top of the dough and your hands with flour. Carefully scrape the sticky dough from the bowl, adding a small amount of flour if needed to keep your hands from sticking.
step 2:
Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and stretch it into a long, 12-16 inch loaf. It's okay if the loaf is lumpy and uneven. The dough will be very soft and sticky, so don't worry too much about the shape.
step 3:
Prepare a baking sheet by smearing olive oil over the surface and then sprinkling with cornmeal. Carefully pick up the loaf and transfer it to the prepared baking sheet, reshaping it as needed. Let the dough rise for 2 hours.
step 4:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees and bake the loaf for 25 minutes, or until it is golden brown. Let the bread cool on a wire rack before slicing.

	name: vegetable oil 
	amount: 1/4
	unit: cup
step 0:
Thaw the tilapia filets (if frozen) by running the sealed packets under cool water for about 5 minutes. Slice each filet length-wise into two or three pieces (depending on width) and then horizontally to yield 4-6 sticks (see photos below).
step 1:
Prepare the breading station by collecting three bowls. In the first bowl combine the flour and cajun seasoning (or salt, pepper, any other seasonings). In the second bowl whisk two eggs. In the third bowl place the panko bread crumbs.
step 2:
Bread the tilapia sticks by first coating in seasoned flour then dipping in egg and finally coating in panko crumbs. Place the breaded sticks on a plate until all of the sticks have been breaded.
step 3:
Heat a large skillet with 2 Tbsp of vegetable oil over medium/high heat. When the pan is very hot it is ready for the fish (a drop of water will sizzle furiously when dropped in the skillet) . Place half of the sticks in the pan and cook on each side until golden brown in color. Drain the fish sticks on a plate covered with paper towel. Wipe out the pan, add the rest of the vegetable oil (2 Tbsp) and cook the second half of the fish sticks the same way.

step 2:
Remove the pot from the heat and carefully strain out the tea bags and spices (Place a colander over a bowl and pour it in). Using whole spices not only adds more flavor but makes straining them out much much easier.
step 3:
While the spiced tea is still hot, stir in the sugar and vanilla. Store the chai concentrate in the refrigerator until you are ready to use.
step 4:
To make a drink, combine one part chai concentrate with one part milk. Heat and serve!

step 0:
Cut the stew meat into smaller chunks (1 inch or smaller). Heat the vegetable oil in a large pot and cook stew meat until it is brown and crispy on the outside surface. Remove the meat from the pot and set aside. Dice the onion and mince the garlic as the meat is cooking.
step 1:
Add the onion and garlic to the pot to cook in the vegetable oil and meat drippings. Cook until softened (2-3 min). Wash, peel and chop the celery and carrots as they cook. Add the celery and carrots and cook 2-3 minutes more.
step 2:
Wash and slice the mushrooms as the carrots and celery are cooking. Add the mushrooms and cook until most of the moisture has evaporated out of the pot. Add the tomato paste, stir and cook for 1-2 minutes more allowing the tomato paste to caramelize. Add the wine to the pot. Stir the wine allowing it to dissolve anything stuck to the bottom of the pot.
step 3:
Add the cooked meat back to the pot along with 6 cups of beef broth (bouillon + water), bay leaves, thyme and dry barley. Bring the mixture up to a boil then reduce the heat and let simmer for about 45 minutes with a lid in place.
step 4:
During the last 5-10 minutes of the simmer time, wash and chop the potatoes. Add the potatoes to the pot and allow to cook 15 minutes more. The potatoes, meat and barley should all be tender by this time. Because potatoes draw salt out of soups, give it a final taste and adjust seasonings as necessary. Remove the bay leaves and thyme stems.

step 0:
In a bowl combine the 1/2 cup mustard, 1 Tbsp olive oil, minced garlic, thyme and parsley. Stir it up good. Place the pork loin in a large dish, coat it with the marinade, cover and refrigerate for at least four hours. Thyme leaves come off easily when you pinch the top and pull backward down the stem.
step 1:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Spray a baking sheet or glass dish with nonstick spray and place the pork loin inside. Scoop up any marinade left in the bowl and paste it over the meat. Roast for about 40 minutes or until the internal temperature reaches 160 degrees.
step 2:
While the pork is roasting, make the sauce. Mince up the shallots and cook them in a skillet with 2 Tbsp of olive oil until they are soft. Add the bouillon, water, 2 Tbsp of dijon and thyme. Let simmer for about 10 minutes (volume will reduce during this time). Turn off the heat then whisk in the sour cream. Season with fresh black pepper.
step 3:
Let the pork rest for at least 5 minutes after you take it out of the oven to let the juices redistribute. Slice on an angle into medallions about .75 inch thick. Plate the medallions and spoon sauce over top.

step 0:
Peel, dice and roast the butternut squash with olive oil, salt, pepper and sage. The squash can roast while the rice cooks (next steps) or you can do it a day ahead of time and keep it in the refrigerator until ready to use.
step 1:
In a large pot, melt 2 Tbsp of butter and add 1.5 cups (or 12 oz.) onion/celery/bell pepper mix. If you do not want to use a frozen mix, substitute one medium yellow onion, one bell pepper and 3 stalks of celery. Cook down until soft and most of the liquid has evaporated (about 5 minutes).
step 2:
Stir the wild rice mix into the vegetables and butter. Continue to cook and stir for about one minute more to toast the rice. You should be able to smell the toasty aroma.
step 3:
Add 3 cups of water, 1 Tbsp chicken base, leaves from 3 sprigs of thyme and 1/2 tsp of dried sage. Add a lid to the pot and bring it up to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and let it simmer for 50 minutes then turn off the heat and let sit for 10 more minutes. Check your rice package for the cooking instructions, they may vary slightly.
step 4:
After you get the wild rice mix going, cook the white rice. The white rice cooks much faster so you want to do it separately to avoid over cooking and turning it to mush. Place the dry white rice in a smaller pot and add 2 cups of water. Place a lid on top, bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low and let simmer for 20 minutes or until all of the liquid is absorbed. Turn the heat off and let sit with the lid in place until ready to use.
step 5:
When the wild rice mix is finished cooking, fluff it up with a fork. Gently stir in the white rice, butternut squash cubes, dried cranberries and chopped walnuts. Give the mix a taste to see if you want to add any additional salt or pepper. Serve garnished with fresh parsley or thyme.

You will use between 2 and 3 cups of all purpose flour total depending on the moisture content of your environment and flour. Keep adding flour and kneading until you have a soft, elastic but not sticky ball. Knead for about 3 minutes.
step 3:
Loosely cover the ball of dough and allow it to rise until double in size (about 45 minutes). Shape the dough into a log the length of your bread pan. Coat the bread pan with non-stick spray or oil and place the dough inside. Allow the dough to rise again until double in size (another 45 minutes).
step 4:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Cut a long slit in the top of the dough to allow for expansion during cooking (a serrated bread knife works great). Once the oven is fully heated, bake the bread for 30 minutes until deep golden on top. Remove the bread from the pan and allow to cool on a wire rack before slicing.

	amount: 10
	unit: oz
step 0:
Brown the sausage in a large pot over medium heat, breaking it up into pieces as it cooks.
step 1:
While the sausage is cooking, prepare your vegetables: wash, peel and slice the carrots, slice the celery, dice the onion, and mince the garlic. Once the sausage is cooked, add the vegetables to the pot and continue to sauté until the onions are soft and transparent (about 5 min).
step 2:
Measure out the lentils and pick through them to make sure there are no stones. Add them to the pot along with the cayenne, cumin, smoked paprika, oregano, and chicken broth.
step 3:
Place a lid on the pot, turn the heat up to medium-high, and allow it to come up to a boil. Once it reaches a boil, reduce the heat to low and let simmer for 30 minutes or until the lentils are tender. Add more water if it gets too dry. 
step 4:
Stir in the frozen spinach and cook for about 15 minutes more. Serve with a thick slice of crusty bread!

cook_time: 45
num_servings: 1
ingredients:
	name: whole wheat flour
	amount: 1
	unit: cup
	name: all purpose flour, divided
	amount: 1 1/2-2
	unit: cups
	name: water
	amount: 1
	unit: cup
	name: honey
	amount: 2
	unit: Tbsp
	name: yeast
	amount: 2
	unit: tsp
	name: olive oil
	amount: 3
	unit: Tbsp
	name: salt
	amount: 1 1/2
	unit: tsp
step 0:
In a small bowl, stir together the water (warm), honey and yeast. Let it sit 3-5 minutes or until very frothy on top.
step 1:
Stir the olive oil and salt into the yeast mixture. Next, stir one cup of whole wheat flour into the wet ingredients until evenly mixed. Stir in the all purpose flour, 1/2 cup at a time, until you can no longer stir it with a spoon.
step 2:
Turn the ball of dough out onto a floured surface and continue to add in and knead the all purpose flour until the ball of dough is stretchy and soft but not sticky (about 3-5 minutes). The total amount of flour needed will depend on how much moisture is already in your flour but it should be between 1-2 cups of all purpose flour.
step 3:
Spray a large bowl with nonstick spray and place the ball of dough inside. Loosely cover with plastic wrap and let sit for about 45 minutes or until doubled in size.
step 4:
To shape the dough, remove it from the bowl it was rising in and place it on a floured surface. Press the dough down into a large circle. This should be fairly easy since it was pretty circular in shape as it rose. Next, pick the dough up with your hands and transfer it to a pizza pan (coated in non-stick spray or sprinkled with corn meal). Press the dough out even further until it reaches the edges of the pan. Alternatively, you can pick the dough up and stretch it with your fists (this can take practice).
step 5:
Top the pizza then bake in a fully preheated, 450 degree oven for about 15 minutes or until the edges are golden brown.

	unit: n/a
step 0:
Slice the sausage and cook in a large pot over medium heat until thoroughly cooked (about 5 minutes). Don’t worry if the drippings begin to stick and coat the bottom of the pan, it will be deglazed later. Remove the cooked meat (leaving the fat/drippings in the pan) and set it aside for later.
step 1:
Add the chopped onion, bell pepper, celery and garlic to the pot with the meat drippings and cook until soft (about 3-5 minutes). The moisture from the vegetables should loosen anything stuck to the bottom of the pan from the meat (all of that flavorful good stuff).
step 2:
Once the vegetables have softened, add the dry rice, cayenne pepper and tomato paste. Stir it all together and cook for approximately 1 minute more. This will allow the tomato paste to caramelize and the rice to toast just slightly.
step 3:
Add 3.5 cups of water, diced tomatoes, bay leaves, thyme, fresh cracked pepper (about 20 cranks) and salt (about 1/2 tsp). Stir it together, then add the meat back into the pot. Bring it up to a simmer, add a lid and reduce the heat to low. Allow the pot to simmer on low until all of the moisture has been absorbed by the rice (about 30 minutes). Stir in the chopped parsley and serve.

	name: cayenne 
	amount: 1/4
	unit: tsp
	name: honey roasted peanuts 
	amount: 1/2
	unit: cup
step 0:
Place 2 Tbsp of vegetable oil and one popcorn kernel in a large pot over high heat with a lid. Wait for the kernel to pop then add the rest of the 1/2 cup of kernels. Swirl the kernels in the pot to coat them with oil and then wait for them to pop. When the popping slows (just like with microwave popcorn) remove it from the heat. I like to keep the lid slightly ajar as they pop to let steam out but keep the jumping kernels in.
step 1:
In a small pot, combine the water, sugar, butter and salt. Place the pot over medium heat and let the mixture come to a boil. Continue to boil the mixture until it is a light gold color (see photos below).
step 2:
While the sugar mixture is boiling, remove any unpopped kernels from the popcorn and add the nuts. Line a large baking sheet with foil and spray with non-stick spray. Preheat the oven to 250 degrees.
step 3:
Once the sugar mixture becomes golden, remove it from the heat and stir in the baking soda and spices (cayenne, chili powder or none). Immediately pour the mixture over the popcorn and nuts and stir to combine. Work quickly as you stir because the mixture will harden as it cools. Pour the popcorn/nut/sugar mix out onto the baking sheet, place in the oven and bake for about 15 minutes. Let the mix cool for 5-10 minutes before eating to let the caramel sauce harden.

step 0:
Saute the almonds and raisins in butter over medium heat for one minute. Add the dry rice and saute for 1-2 minutes more or until it looks slightly golden and toasted. Watch the heat carefully, if the butter or sugar from the raisins begins to burn take it off of the heat immediately.
step 1:
Add the milk, sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla and bay leaf to the pot. Using a whisk stir it well so there are no clumps. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium/high heat while stirring often with a whisk. As soon as it comes to a boil, reduce the heat to medium/low and let it continue to simmer until thickened (30-40 min). Stir often with a whisk to prevent caking and burning on the bottom.
step 2:
After 30-40 minutes the rice should be soft and the mixture should be thick and creamy. Serve hot or cold.

	name: salt 
	amount: 1/2
	unit: Tbsp
	name: water* 
	amount: 1.5 to 1.75
	unit: cup
step 0:
The day before baking, combine the flour, yeast, and salt in a large bowl and stir until they're well combined. Stir in about 1.5 to 1.75 cups room temperature water until a shaggy, sticky ball of dough forms and there is no dry flour left on the bottom of the bowl. Cover the bowl loosely with plastic and let it sit at room temperature for 12-18 hours.
step 1:
When you're ready to bake, sprinkle a little flour on top of the fermented dough, and scrape it out of the bowl (the dough should be very light, fluffy, and bubbly by this time). With well floured hands, shape the dough into a ball and place it on a piece of parchment paper. Let the dough rise for 30-60 minutes.
step 2:
While the dough is rising, preheat the oven to 425ºF, or the highest recommended temperature listed on the packaging for your parchment paper. Place the Dutch oven inside the oven as it heats, and make sure it sits in the fully heated oven for at least 15 minutes before baking the bread.
step 3:
Once the bread has risen and the Dutch oven is fully heated, carefully remove the Dutch oven from the oven (it will be EXTREMELY hot). Lift the parchment with the dough straight into the dutch oven and cover it with the lid.
step 4:
Return the Dutch oven to the oven and bake for 30 minutes. Carefully remove the lid and bake for another 15-20 minutes, or until the crust is a deep golden brown. Remove the Dutch oven from the oven, lift the bread out by by using the parchment paper, and allow it to cool before cutting open and serving.

step 0:
Dice the onion and mince the garlic. Cook them in a large stock pot over medium heat with the olive oil until soft. Add the chopped carrots and celery and cook a few minutes more.
step 1:
Add the ham hock and peas to the pot. Add enough water to just cover the top of the ham hock (6-8 cups). Add a bay leaf and 6 tsp (or cubes) of chicken bouillon. Bring the mixture up to a simmer with a lid on then reduce the heat to low and let simmer for 1 hour.
step 2:
Dice the potato into small chunks, add to the pot and continue to simmer until the potato chunks are soft (about ten minutes). The peas should have completely disintegrated by this point as well. If they are still retaining their shape, continue to simmer until they are mush (see photo below).
step 3:
Remove the bay leaf and ham hock. Transfer 1/3 to 1/2 of the soup to a blender and puree until smooth. Return it to the pot and mix it in with the rest of the soup. Remove the meat from the ham hock, cut it into small pieces and return it to the pot. Taste the soup and adjust salt and pepper to taste!

step 0:
Place the lentils in a pot and cover with a couple inches of water. Bring to a boil over high heat and boil until tender (about ten minutes). Drain the lentils in a colander.
step 1:
While the lentils are boiling, mince the garlic and peel and grate the ginger (use a small cheese grater). Return the drained lentils to the pot (medium heat) and add the butter, ginger, garlic, cayenne, cumin, salt and pepper.
step 2:
Add the can of tomatoes and one cup of water. Stir it all together, bring it to a simmer then reduce the heat to low. Put a lid on the pot and let it simmer for half an hour. The mixture should be soft and thick after a half hour. If it is not, continue to simmer, adding more water if it dries out. You want the end product to be thick, not watery.
step 3:
Stir in the evaporated milk or cream and garnish with fresh, chopped cilantro. Serve over rice or with naan bread for dipping!

num_servings: 10
ingredients:
	name: flour 
	amount: 4
	unit: cups
	name: salt 
	amount: 1 1/2
	unit: tsp
	name: honey or sugar
	amount: 1
	unit: Tbsp
	name: yeast 
	amount: 1 1/2
	unit: tsp
	name: cinnamon 
	amount: 2
	unit: tsp
	name: raisins 
	amount: 1/2
	unit: cup
step 0:
In a small bowl combine the honey, yeast and 1.25 cups warm water. Stir to dissolve and let sit for five minutes or until the surface is covered with foam.
step 1:
In a large bowl combine 2 cups of the flour and the salt. Stir to combine. Add the frothy yeast water and stir well until everything is evenly mixed. Continue adding flour 1/2 cup at a time until it is too hard to stir by hand (about one cup later). Turn the dough out onto a well floured surface and continue adding flour a little bit at a time and knead in until you have reached 3.5 to 4 cups total (depending on the humidity). You can stop adding flour when it becomes fairly stiff but still pliable enough to knead. Knead the dough for 8 minutes total.
step 2:
After kneading, flatten the dough slightly and add the cinnamon and raisins down the center. Fold the dough over and knead a few more times until the raisins are even throughout the dough and the cinnamon has given the dough a swirly appearance. The raisins and cinnamon may “break out” of the dough while you knead it in but just keep going and let the dough pick it back up as you knead.
step 3:
Form the dough into a ball, loosely cover and let it rise until double (about 45 min.). Punch the down down, form it into a log and cut it into 10 pieces (for medium bagels). Form each piece into a ball by pulling the dough back and under itself. When you have a smooth ball, pinch it in the center to make the hole then carefully stretch the hole until it is a couple inches across. Make the hole about 3x larger than you think it should be because the dough will puff up quite a bit during cooking and close the hole off. Form the rest of the bagels in the same manner.
step 4:
Place the formed bagels on a baking sheet covered with parchment paper and cornmeal or non-stick spray. Let rise until double in size (about 45 minutes). Preheat your broiler near the end of the rise time.
step 5:
Put a large pot of water on to boil. While you wait for it to boil, place the tray of bagels under the broiler for one minute. Pull the bagels out, carefully turn them over then place them back in to broil on the second side. Every oven is different so watch the bagels closely. You do not want them to brown just turn slightly dull on the surface.
step 6:
Once the bagels have broiled on both sides, turn the oven to 375 to preheat. When the water has come to a full, rolling boil, drop the bagels in a few at a time. Boil the bagels for one minute, flip them over and boil for another minute on the opposite side. I found that a long chopstick works well for flipping them in the boiling water.
step 7:
As the bagels come out of the water, let them drain on a wire cooling rack so the bottoms don’t get soggy. After draining for about 5 minutes, place them on a baking sheet and bake for about 30 minutes or until the surface is golden brown.

step 0:
Boil a large pot of water and cook the macaroni noodles according to the package directions (boil for 10-15 minutes or until al dente). Drain and set aside until ready to use.
step 1:
Chop the onion and mince the garlic cloves. Cook both in a large skillet in 2 Tbsp of olive oil over medium heat until soft (about 5 min.). Add the sliced mushrooms and cook until they are soft and brown in color (a dash of salt will help).
step 2:
Preheat the oven to 350. Add the undrained can of tomatoes and the thawed package of spinach to the skillet. I did not drain either one so that the juices would add more flavor. Heat all of the vegetables through then season to taste with salt, fresh ground pepper, nutmeg, cayenne and red pepper flakes (or whatever seasonings you like).
step 3:
Stir the cooked vegetables into the pasta (I used the original pasta pot as it was the only thing large enough to hold everything). Dice the mozzarella into small chunks. Combine the parmesan and breadcrumbs in a small bowl. Add the mozzarella and parmesan mixture to the pasta and stir until everything is evenly combined.
step 4:
Coat a large glass baking dish with non-stick spray and transfer the pasta mixture into it. Cover the dish with foil (to keep the top from drying) and bake for 25-30 minutes or until the cheese has fully melted.

	name: as needed non-stick spray 
	amount: n/a
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. In a bowl combine the honey, soy sauce, chili garlic sauce, rice vinegar, sesame oil and teriyaki sauce. Peel the ginger and grate it into the bowl using a small cheese grater. Mince the garlic and add it as well. Stir it all to combine.
step 1:
Place the chicken wings in a colander and rinse well (you don’t know what gets on them in the factory). Cut each wing at the joint to yield a drummet and a wing (see photos below). Add the wings to the bowl of sauce and stir to coat.
step 2:
Spray a glass baking dish well with non-stick spray to make clean up easy. Dump the whole bowl of wings and sauce into the baking dish. Bake at 450 degrees for 25 minutes, stirring once after 15 minutes to recoat the wings in sauce.
step 3:
After 25 minutes of baking, stir the wings to recoat with sauce then turn the oven on to broil. Broil for 3-5 minutes, stir then broil again for 3-5 minutes. Because broiling cooks fast and every oven is different, keep an eye on the wings. Stir them when the tops have turned nice and brown and then broil the other side. For me it was between 3-5 minutes. The sauce should have reduced and thickened significantly during the broiling stage.
step 4:
Let the wings cool for 5 minutes before serving. The sauce will thicken further as it cools. Stir the wings around in the sauce to coat them well before serving. Sprinkle sliced green onions on top.

	name: cinnamon, divided
	amount: 2
	unit: tsp
	name: salt 
	amount: 1/4
	unit: tsp
step 0:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Let the butter come to room temperature. Combine 1/2 cup of the powdered sugar with the butter. Whip the butter and sugar together until they are well incorporated and have a “creamed” texture (see photos below). You can use a mixer or a good ‘ol fork and some elbow grease. Then stir in the vanilla extract.
step 1:
In a separate bowl, combine the 1.5 cups of flour with 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of salt. Mix them until the are evenly combined.
step 2:
Stir the flour mixture into the creamed butter and sugar mixture. If the mix is still too sticky to form into balls with your hands, add more flour, 1/4 cup at a time. I added somewhere between 1/2 to 3/4 cup more after the initial 1.5 cups.
step 3:
Shape the dough into 24 evenly sized balls (think ping pong balls). Combine the remaining 1/2 cup of powdered sugar and 1 tsp of cinnamon in a bowl and roll each ball in the sugar mixture to coat.
step 4:
Place the sugar coated dough balls on a baking sheet and bake for 15-20 minutes at 350 degrees or until they are a light golden brown in color. Let the cookies cool before eating for optimum crumbly texture!

	unit: tsp
step 0:
Preheat the oven to 450ºF and line a baking sheet with foil. Cut the stems off the tomatoes, then cut them in half. Peel the cloves of garlic and chop the onion into large chunks. Place the tomatoes, onion, garlic, poblano and jalapeño (leave the peppers whole for now) on the baking sheet and drizzle with 2 Tbsp of olive oil. Toss all of the vegetables around in the oil until they are completely coated.
step 1:
Place the vegetables in the 450ºF oven and roast for 30 minutes, stirring once half way through. The vegetables should be shriveled, blistered and slightly brown after 30 minutes (see photos below). After roasting, remove them from the oven and allow to cool.
step 2:
Place the poblano and jalapeño peppers on a cutting board. Remove the thick skin from the poblano (it should peel away easily). Slice off the stems, then slice the peppers open lengthwise. Scrape the seeds out of the peppers. The peppers should be very soft and easy to work with (see photos below).
step 3:
Transfer the peppers and everything left on the baking sheet (including juices) into a blender or food processor. If the vegetables are still warm, you can place the blender into the refrigerator until they have cooled down.
step 4:
Add the fresh cilantro leaves, juice from the lime (about 1/4 cup), salt, sugar, and cumin to the blender with the roasted vegetables. Pulse the ingredients until they are well mixed but still slightly chunky. Don’t over puree on the first round so that you can taste the mixture, adjust the seasonings, and blend again if needed.
step 5:
Serve immediately or let refrigerate over night for a more mellow flavor.

	name: powdered sugar 
	amount: 1
	unit: cup
	name: blueberries, frozen or fresh
	amount: 1/2
	unit: cup
step 0:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. In a large bowl combine the flour, salt, sugar, baking powder and the zest from the lemon (use a zester or the smallest grate on a cheese grater). Mix them well to make sure there are no clumps and everything is combined evenly.
step 1:
In a smaller bowl, combine the milk and eggs. Whisk well.
step 2:
Cut the butter into chunks and put it into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Using your hands, “smoosh” the butter into the flour over and over until there are no more clumps and it is completely combined with the flour. It should look like coarse sand (see photos below). You can use special kitchen tools for this but I find that my hands are just as quick and effective.
step 3:
Stir the blueberries into the wet ingredients then pour all of that into the bowl of dry ingredients. Stir it all together until everything has combined (thorough mixing is not necessary). The dough will be very wet and sticky, don’t worry.
step 4:
Liberally flour your countertop to keep the wet dough from sticking. Dump the ball of wet dough onto the floured surface and pat it down into a circle about 8 inches wide and one inch thick. Using a sharp knife, cut the circle into eight pieces (see photos below).
step 5:
Place the “wedges” on a baking sheet covered in parchment paper or foil (for easy clean up). Bake in the 450 degree oven for 12-15 minutes.
step 6:
While the scones are baking, make the lemon icing. Place one cup of powdered sugar in a small bowl and juice the lemon into it, taking care not to let any seeds fall in. Start with half of the lemon then stir the icing. It will not look like enough moisture until you have it all stirred up (the sugar sort of melts into it). If it is still too thick/stiff, juice the other half of the lemon. You want the icing thick but still loose enough to drizzle over the scones.
step 7:
When the scones are golden brown on top, remove them from the oven and let cool. Be sure to let the scones cool before adding the icing or else it will melt and slide right off!.

step 0:
To make the coconut rice: Place the jasmine rice, garlic (minced), coconut milk, 2/3 cup of water and 1/2 tsp of salt into a pot. Stir to combine the ingredients. Place a lid on the pot and place over high heat until it comes to a boil. As soon as it comes to a full boil (watch closely) lower the heat to the lowest setting. Keeping the lid in place (don’t open it to peek!) and over low heat for 30 minutes. Turn the heat off after 30 minutes and let rest with the lid in place until you are ready to use the rice.
step 1:
Heat 2 Tbsp of olive oil over high heat in a large skillet. Slice the onions thinly and saute in the hot oil until they are golden brown on the edges.
step 2:
Add the frozen vegetables and saute until they have warmed through. Add the drained pineapple chunks and a pinch of salt and pepper.
step 3:
When the rice has finished cooking, fluff it with a fork and add it to the skillet with the vegetables. Turn the heat off under the skillet and stir to combine the ingredients. Serve the pilaf with soy sauce and sriracha!

	name: pork butt roast, boston butt
	amount: 3
	unit: lbs
	name: medium sweet onion 
	amount: 1
	unit: n/a
	name: teriyaki sauce 
	amount: 1
	unit: cup
	name: pineapple slices 
	amount: 15 oz
	unit: can
	name: fresh ginger, optional

	name: pack hamburger/sandwich buns 
	amount: 8
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Slice the onion and place it in the bottom of your slow cooker.
step 1:
Remove the pork roast from it’s wrapper and remove any netting surrounding the meat (if any). Cut the pork roast into a few large chunks and place in a single layer in the slow cooker. If desired, trim fat from the pork roast before placing in the slow cooker.
step 2:
Pour one cup of teriyaki sauce over the pork roast. Pour the juice from the can of pineapple into the slow cooker as well. Save the pineapple slices to top the sandwiches later. If using fresh ginger (I had some on hand so I added it just for fun), peel and grate it into the slow cooker.
step 3:
Cover the slow cooker and turn on high heat for two hours then reduce to low heat for another 4 hours. If you do not have a programmable slow cooker or are not home to adjust the heat, set the slow cooker on low for 8 hours.
step 4:
Carefully remove the lid after 6-8 hours and remove the pork chunks. They should fall apart and shred easily with a fork. Stir 3 Tbsp of flour into a half cup of water then whisk into the juices left in the slow cooker. Set the heat to high, put the lid on and let it simmer for 30 minutes. Stir once half way through.
step 5:
The juices should have thickened after adding the flour and simmering. Return the shredded meat to the pot and stir into the teriyaki gravy. Serve 1 cup of meat and gravy over a toasted bun with a pineapple slice on top!

	unit: 15 oz. can
	name: baby spinach
	amount: 4
	unit: oz
	name: shredded parmesan
	amount: 3
	unit: oz
step 0:
Fill a large pot with water and place over high heat to bring it to a boil. Once boiling, add the pasta and cook according to the package directions (boil for 7-10 minutes). Drain the pasta in a colander.
step 1:
While you’re waiting for the water to boil, mince the garlic. Heat the olive oil and butter in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add the garlic and sauté for about a minute, or until it has softened and become very fragrant.
step 2:
Add the tomatoes, salt, pepper and basil. Sauté the tomatoes until the skins burst and the tomatoes begin to release their juices. It's important to not have the heat under the skillet too high here or the garlic may burn before the tomatoes break down. You want the garlic to brown and caramelize a bit, but not burn.
step 3:
Once the tomatoes begin to break down, add the spinach and stir it into the tomatoes until it is about half way wilted. 
step 4:
Rinse and drain the can of cannellini beans. Add the beans to the skillet and stir until they are heated through. The tomato juices will have created a thick sauce-like mixture on the bottom of the skillet at this point. Taste the mixture and add a bit more salt if needed. It should be slightly on the salty side in order to properly flavor the pasta.
step 5:
Add the cooked and drained pasta to the skillet. Toss until the pasta is coated in the sticky sauce and everything is combined. Top with shredded parmesan, plus add a bit of Parmesan to the top of each bowl.

	unit: n/a
	name: sliced green onions, optional
	amount: 3
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Preheat your countertop grill (George Foreman type). Season both sides of the chicken breast by sprinkling them lightly with garlic powder, cayenne, cumin, salt and pepper (about 1/2 tsp of each total). Grill the chicken breast until cooked through and golden brown (about 7 minutes each).
step 1:
Let the chicken breasts cool slightly so the juices redistribute inside the meat. While the meat is cooling, combine the sour cream, 1 cup of cheese and green chiles in a bowl. Dice the chicken meat and stir it into the sour cream mixture.
step 2:
Preheat your oven to 350 degrees. Spray the inside of a large casserole dish with non-stick spray. Place one spoonful (about 1/4 to 1/3 cup) down the center of a small tortilla and roll it closed. Place it in the casserole dish seam side down. Repeat until all of the filling is used up (about ten tortillas).
step 3:
Pour the enchilada sauce over the top and bake at 350 for 30 minutes. After baking for 30 minutes, sprinkle the remaining 1 cup of cheese over top and set the oven to broil. Broil for 5 minutes or until the cheese is melted and bubbly. Top with tomatoes and green onions if desired!

	name: shredded mozzarella 
	amount: 2
	unit: cups
	name: as needed non-stick spray 
	amount: n/a
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Wash the eggplant and slice into 1/2 inch thick rounds. Place it in a colander, sprinkle with 1 Tbsp of salt, toss to coat and let sit for about 45 minutes. The salt will draw out moisture from the eggplant allowing for more crisp slices once breaded and baked. After 45 minutes, give the colander a good shake to let extra water drip out the bottom (it will look brown).
step 1:
Press the eggplant slices between a few sheets of paper towel (or a clean, lint-free cloth) to absorb excess water. Place the slices in a ziplock bag with 1/3 cup of all-purpose flour. Toss the bag so that the slices become coated with the flour.
step 2:
Prepare the second two steps in the breading process as follows. Lightly beat three eggs in a bowl until they become a fairly even consistency. In another bowl combine the bread crumbs, parmesan cheese, garlic powder and parsley flakes. If you have Italian seasoned bread crumbs, you can skip the parsley flakes and/or the garlic powder. Dip each slice of eggplant into the egg (turning to coat both sides) then into the bread crumb mixture (coating each side again). Place the breaded slices on a plate or baking sheet until all slices have been breaded.
step 3:
Position your oven racks on the top third and bottom third of the oven so that they have at least 6 inches between them for air to flow. Preheat your oven to 425 degrees. Place two baking sheets in the oven (one on each rack) as it preheats so they will be preheated as well (this helps with crisping).
step 4:
Once all of your eggplant slices are breaded and the oven/baking sheets are preheated, carefully remove the baking sheets and coat them with non-stick spray. Arrange the eggplant slices in a single layer on the sheets and spray the tops of them with another coat of non-stick spray. Place the sheets back in the oven and bake for about 30 minutes. Switch the position of the baking sheets half way through (the top rack is often hotter and browns faster than the bottom).
step 5:
After the slices have baked, reduce the oven heat to 350 degrees. Spray a large casserole dish with non-stick spray. Place 1 cup of marinara sauce in the bottom of the dish. Arrange eggplant slices in a single layer over the marinara. Top with a second cup of marinara and one cup of mozzarella. Arrange the rest of the eggplant slices over top and then cover with a third cup of marinara and a second cup of mozarella. Sauce, eggplant, sauce, cheese, eggplant, sauce, cheese. Got it?
step 6:
Bake the casserole for about 30 minutes or until the cheese on top is melted and bubbly. Garnish with fresh chopped parsley if desired.
step 7:
Relax a minute after all of that baking, enjoy a heaping portion of Eggplant Parmesan and try not to go back for seconds!

	name: sriracha hot sauce
	amount: 1/2
	unit: tsp
	name: non-stick spray as needed
	amount: n/a
	unit: n/a
step 0:
In a bowl, combine the cream cheese, green onion, egg and Sriracha until well combined. Add the lobster and break the chunks up slightly as you stir it in.
step 1:
Get a small bowl of water to help seal the edges of the wonton wrappers. Working in groups of about 6 wontons at a time, place about one teaspoon of the cheese filling in the center of each wonton square. Using your fingers, wet the wrapper all along the four sides. Fold them diagonally corner to corner and pinch the wrapper together to seal. Try to squeeze the air out as you make the first fold. Bring the two opposite points of the triangle together around front and squeeze together to seal. See the photos below to see how this is done.
step 2:
Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil. Working in groups of about 8-10 wontons, drop them into the boiling water and remove them once they begin to float (about 3 minutes). Place the boiled wontons on a cooling rack placed over a baking sheet so the excess water can drain off. The wontons skins should now look nice and transparent.
step 3:
Once all of the wontons have been boiled, heat a large non-stick skillet coated with non-stick spray oil over medium-high heat. When it is nice and hot, place about 8 wontons in at a time. “Fry” the wontons on each side until they are golden brown, blistered and crispy in some spots. You may need to spray more non-stick spray as you go, it will help crisp up the wontons.

step 0:
Prepare the vegetables before you begin to cook. Mince the garlic and either mince or grate the ginger. Peel and dice the carrot. Thinly slice the green bell pepper, and slice the green onions.
step 1:
Heat a large skillet or wok over medium heat. Add 1 Tbsp of the cooking oil and swirl to coat the surface. Add the ginger and garlic to the skillet and briefly sauté for about one minute or just until they become fragrant. Add the diced carrot and the white ends of the sliced green onion (save the tender green ends for adding after cooking). Sauté for about two minutes more.
step 2:
Add the frozen peas and sliced green bell pepper. Continue to sauté for 2-3 minutes, or just until the green bell peppers begin to soften. Add the rice and sauté for 2-3 minutes more, or just until the rice is heated through.
step 3:
Crack the eggs into a bowl and briefly whisk. Push the contents of the skillet off to the sides, exposing the skillet in the center. Add one additional tablespoon of cooking oil to the skillet in the center, then pour in the whisked eggs. Cook the eggs for 1-2 minutes, gently scrambling, until they are mostly cooked through, then stir to mix them into the other ingredients in the skillet.
step 4:
Drizzle the soy sauce and toasted sesame oil over the skillet and stir to combine. At this point everything should be heated through and coated in sauce. Serve immediately with fresh green onion sprinkled over top.

	name: nutmeg
	amount: 1/4
	unit: tsp
	name: dried cranberries (optional)
	amount: 1/2
	unit: cup
step 0:
Preheat your oven to 350 degrees. In a large bowl, combine the flour, salt and baking powder. Stir very well so that the baking powder is evenly distributed.
step 1:
In a second bowl, combine the eggs, sugar, butter, vanilla extract, almond extract, cinnamon, nutmeg and lemon zest. Whisk it all together until it is evenly incorporated and has a light creamy appearance (see photos below).
step 2:
Pour the wet mixture into the dry flour mixture. Stir until it is evenly combined and you have a wet dough that is similar to cookie batter. Fold in the sliced almonds and dried cranberries (if using).
step 3:
On a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, form two semi-flat logs about 2 inches wide and 12 inches long (see photos below). Make sure the logs are a few inches apart because they will expand slightly while baking. Bake at 350 degrees for 35 minutes.
step 4:
Using a spatula, remove the logs to a cutting board. Cut the logs into 1 inch thick slices on a diagonal (this makes the biscotti longer). A serrated knife works best for slicing the biscotti. Place the slices back on the baking sheet. Bake the slices for 5-7 minutes more on each side (depending on how crisp you like them). Larger, thicker logs will require a more time to crisp up.
step 5:
Allow the biscotti to cool. Enjoy the biscotti plain or dunked in coffee!

	name: salt 
	amount: 1
	unit: tsp
	name: 1-2 sprigs fresh mint, minced 
	amount: 2
	unit: Tbsp
step 0:
Finely dice the yellow onion and mince the garlic. Cook them in a skillet with 2 Tbsp of olive oil over medium/high heat until they are soft and translucent. Transfer them to a mixing bowl to cool.
step 1:
Add the rice, mint, salt and 1/4 cup (4 Tbsp) of lemon juice to the mixing bowl with the cooked onions and garlic. Stir to combine well.
step 2:
Gently unroll/unfold the grape leaves from the jar and lay flat on a clean surface (3 or 4 at a time). Place 1 tsp to 1 Tbsp (depending on the size of the leaf) of rice mix at the bottom near where the stem would attach. Roll the grape leaves by first folding the bottom up, then the right and left sides in then rolling all the way toward the top (see photos below). Do not roll tightly as the rice will expand when the Dolmas cook in the next step. Continue to fill and roll each grape leaf this way.
step 3:
As you roll the grape leaves place them in the bottom of a wide pot, seam side down, very close together (see photos below). If you fill the bottom of the pot in a single layer and still have more, you can start a second layer.
step 4:
Drizzle the reamaining 2 Tbsp of olive oil and 2 Tbsp of lemon juice over top of the Dolmas in the pot. Fill with water just until the Dolmas are covered. Place a large plate or dish on top of the Dolmas to hold them down and keep them from unraveling as they boil. Place the pot over high heat, bring to a boil then reduce the temperature and simmer until the rice is soft (about 30-40 minutes). Add more water as needed. Gently remove the Dolmas from the pot after cooking. Reserve any left over liquid to be poured over any left over Dolmas while they are stored in the refrigerator.

	unit: cup

	amount: n/a
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Preheat your oven to 325 degrees. Cut the loaf of french bread into one inch chunks. If it is stale already, move onto the next step. If it is fresh, spread it out on a baking sheet and bake for about 10 minutes, stirring once. This will remove some of the moisture from the bread allowing it to soak up the custard mixture.
step 1:
While your bread is in the oven drying out, prepare the custard. In a large bowl whisk together the milk, eggs, 1 cup of apple sauce, cinnamon, sugar and lemon zest. Whisk until well combined.
step 2:
Spray the interior of a glass casserole dish with non-stick spray (I used a large 9×11 dish. You can use an 8×8 to make a deeper/taller bread pudding). Fill the baking dish with the bread chunks, pressing down if needed.
step 3:
Pour the custard liquid over the bread chunks as evenly as possible. Sprinkle the raisins over top of the bread chunks and give it a gentle stir to evenly distribute the raisins and custard. Drop chunks of butter on top if desired (2 Tbsp total). You can add the second cup of apple sauce on top before baking (drop dollops of it on top and wiggle it down between bread chunks) or you can add it after baking. I like to add it cold after baking because I like the temperature contrast.
step 4:
Bake the bread pudding at 325 degrees for 45 minutes. Serve hot.

	amount: 1
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Wash, seed and finely dice the cucumber, jalapeno, tomatillo and yellow onion. Split the chopped veggies into two bowls. Half will be pureed with the other soup ingredients and the other half will be added at the end for texture.
step 1:
In a blender combine the crushed tomatoes, half of the chopped veggies, the minced garlic, parsley, cilantro, olive oil, lemon, salt, pepper and half of the V8. If all of the V8 will fit in your blender, go ahead and add all of it but don’t let the liquid exceed 3/4 of the blender’s volume. Puree these ingredients on a fairly low setting until almost smooth (see photo below). Taste and adjust the salt and pepper to your liking.
step 2:
Pour the contents of the blender into a bowl and stir in the remaining chopped veggies and remaining V8 juice. Dice the avocado and either sprinkle on just before serving or stir into the soup. If you stir it in, the acid from the tomatoes and lemon will keep it from browning. Let the soup chill for at least 30 minutes to blend the flavors. Serve cold!

step 0:
Rinse the peaches, cut into quarters and peel (a sharp paring knife works best for this). Cut the peeled quarters into a small dice. Place the diced peaches in a bowl.
step 1:
Cut 1/4 of a red onion into as small of a dice as possible then roughly chop to achieve very small pieces. Peel one inch of the ginger and grate into the bowl (use a small cheese grater or microplane, see photos below). Peel and grate the garlic into the bowl as well. Stir everything together.

	unit: tsp
	name: salt 
	amount: 3/4
	unit: tsp
	name: cold butter 
	amount: 4
	unit: Tbsp
step 0:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Mix the vinegar or lemon juice into one cup of milk and place in the refrigerator until you need it.
step 1:
In a large bowl combine 2 cups of flour with the baking powder, baking soda and salt. Stir well to make sure the ingredients are evenly combined. The mixture will not be stirred much after this step.
step 2:
Slice the butter into pats and add to the flour mixture. Using your hands, mush the butter into the flour mixture until it is evenly incorporated. It will have a fine, sandy texture when it’s all mixed in (see photos below). You can also use a food processor for this step.
step 3:
Stir in the cold milk just until the mixture is completely wet. The dough will be very wet and sticky at this point.
step 4:
Liberally flour the counter top and your hands. Turn the dough out onto the counter, sprinkle with some flour and pat it down until it is about 3/4 inch thick. Using a cookie/biscuit cutter or some other round object (a glass or empty can) cut the biscuits out of the dough. Place the cut biscuits onto a baking sheet lined with foil or parchment paper. Take the remaining dough, form into a ball and pat it out to 3/4 inch again. Cut more biscuits and repeat until all of the dough is used up.
step 5:
Bake the biscuits in the 450 degree oven for 15 minutes or until they are golden brown on top. After baking slice them open, slather with butter and honey and enjoy your morning!

step 0:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Peel the sweet potatoes, wash them with cool water then cut into 1/2 inch thick “stix.” Cut them as evenly as possible so they cook at an even rate.
step 1:
Place the stix in a bowl, drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with seasoning. Use your hands to mix the ingredients until the sweet potato stix are evenly covered with oil and seasoning.
step 2:
Line a baking sheet (or two) with either parchment paper or foil. Spread the stix out on the baking sheet(s) so they are in a single layer. I had to use two sheets to make sure they were in one layer. Bake for about 45 minutes or until they are golden brown on the edges. Stir/flip the stix half way through so the under sides get exposed to the hot dry air.
step 3:
Add more seasoning, if necessary, after cooking.

	name: active dry yeast 
	amount: 1
	unit: tsp
	name: sugar, divided
	amount: 1
	unit: Tbsp
	name: warm water

	amount: 2

	name: all-purpose flour, divided
	amount: 3
	unit: cups
	name: salt 
	amount: 3/4
	unit: tsp
	name: cornmeal 
	amount: 1/4
	unit: cup
step 0:
Dissolve the yeast and half of the sugar into 1/2 cup warm water in a large bowl, and let it sit for about 5 minutes, or until it has developed a thick foam on top.
step 1:
While waiting for the yeast, combine the milk, butter, and the rest of the sugar in a measuring cup or microwave safe bowl. Microwave on high for 30 seconds, then stir until the butter is dissolved. Add an additional 10 seconds if needed. You want the milk warm enough to melt the butter, but not scalding.
step 2:
Once the yeast is foamy, pour the milk and butter mixture into the bowl, along with 1 cup of the flour, and the salt. Stir until the mixture is mostly smooth. Add the second cup of flour, about 1/3 cup at a time, stirring to combine each time. Finally, begin to add the third cup of flour, 1/3 cup at a time, until you can no longer stir it with a spoon. At that point, turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for about 5 minutes, dusting with small amounts of flour as you go. Once finished kneading, you should have used 2.5-3 cups flour total.
step 3:
Let the dough rest for 15 minutes, then roll it out to about 1/2-inch thickness. Use a cookie cutter or sharp edged drinking glass to cut several discs out of the rolled dough. Cut them as close to each other as possible to leave few scraps. When you can cut no more circles, ball the scrap dough up, flatten it once again, and cut a few more. Place the cut muffins on a baking sheet coated with a liberal layer of cornmeal.
step 4:
Let the muffins rise in a warm moist area for about 1.5 hours, or until they are slightly more than double the size. (I placed a casserole dish full of steaming water on the bottom rack of my oven and placed the baking sheet on the top rack to keep the muffins moist as they rose.)
step 5:
When the muffins are large and fluffy, it's time to cook them in a skillet. Heat a cast-iron or non-stick skillet over medium low heat. Once the skillet is preheated, carefully use a spatula to lift 3-4 muffins from the baking sheet and slide them into the skillet, along with some cornmeal. Let the muffins cook 3-4 minutes, or until lightly golden brown on the bottom. Carefully flip the muffins and cook for 3-4 minutes on the second side. The muffins will puff further as they cook in the skillet. Once the muffins are golden on both sides and sound hollow when tapped, transfer them to a wire rack to cool.
step 6:
Once completely cool, split the muffins with a fork and toast in a toaster or the oven. Or, transfer the cooled muffins to an air-tight container and keep in the refrigerator for up to one week, or the freezer for up to three months.

step 0:
Fill a large pot with water (about 2/3 full) and bring to a rolling boil. Cook the pasta according to the package directions (boil 5-7 minutes or until al dente). Drain in a colander.
step 1:
While the pasta boils, dice the onion and mince the garlic. Add the olive oil to a large skillet and heat it over medium. Add the onion, garlic, anchovy filets and red pepper flakes to the oil in the skillet and sauté until softened (5 minutes).
step 2:
Add the canned tomatoes, roughly chopped kalamata olives, capers and roughly chopped basil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer until the pasta is done cooking (about 10 minutes). If the sauce has too much of a bite for you, add 1/2 Tbsp. of brown sugar to mellow it out.
step 3:
Once the pasta is cooked and drained, add it to the skillet with the puttanesca sauce. Stir well to combine. Alternatively, place cooked past on a plate and top with a scoop of puttanesca sauce.

step 0:
Add 3 cups of chicken broth to a medium sauce pot (if using Better Than Bouillon or another soup base, fully dissolve the base in the water before adding the rice). Add the rice to the pot, place a lid on top, and bring the pot to a full boil over high heat. As soon as the pot reaches a full boil, turn the heat down to low and let the pot simmer for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, turn the heat off and let the pot rest for 10 minutes, with the lid in place, undisturbed.
step 1:
While the rice is cooking, prepare the cilantro lime mix. Rinse the cilantro well. Pull the leaves from the stems and roughly chop the leaves with a knife. Use a fine hole cheese grater or zester to remove the thin green layer of zest from the lime. Add the chopped cilantro, lime zest, juice from the lime, and 1 Tbsp olive oil to a bowl. Stir to combine.
step 2:
When the rice is finished cooking, fluff the rice. Add the cilantro lime mixture and fold to combine. Avoid vigorous stirring as this can make the rice gummy. Gently fold the flavor in.

	amount: 1/4
	unit: bunch
step 0:
Thaw your shrimp (if purchased frozen) in the refrigerator over night. Place the shrimp in a colander and remove the tails (if still attached, they pull off easily). Briefly rinse and let drain in the colander. Place the shrimp in a small bowl or container and combine with the seasoning packet, 2 Tbsp of olive oil and 2 Tbsp of red wine vinegar (the packet says 4 Tbsp of oil but I didn’t find that necessary). Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
step 1:
While the shrimp is marinating, prepare your other toppings. Chop the tomatoes and mango into small chunks (instructions on how to cut a mango here). To make the jalapeno sour cream, combine the light sour cream with green Tabasco and stir well. Adjust the Tabasco amount to your liking.
step 2:
Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium/high heat. When it is nice and hot, dump the contents of your shrimp bowl (marinade and all) into the skillet. Cook the shrimp just until it is no longer transparent (about five minutes). Stir and flip the shrimp as they cook. Remove them from the heat as soon as they have all changed color (from transparent/grey to white/pink).
step 3:
Build the tacos by laying five shrimp in the center of a tortilla. Drizzle a little of the saucy juice from the skillet over the shrimp. Top with diced tomato, mango, cilantro leaves, a handful of salad mix and a dollop of jalapeno Tabasco sour cream. EAT UP!

	amount: n/a
	unit: n/a
step 0:
In a resealable container combine the Sriracha, rice vinegar, minced garlic and grated ginger. Slice the chicken breasts diagonally into 6 strips each and mix to coat in the Sriracha marinade. Cover the container with the marinade and chicken and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
step 1:
Preheat your oven to 400 degrees. Set up your dredging station by getting three bowls. Fill the first with the all-purpose flour, in the second whisk the egg and 1 Tbsp of water and in the third bowl place the panko bread crumbs. Also get a clean plate or dish ready to hold the breaded chicken strips.
step 2:
Taking one chicken strip from the marinade at a time, wipe off the excess Sriracha then dip to coat in the flour, then the egg and lastly the panko crumbs. Make sure all surfaces of the chicken strip get covered with each. Gently place the breaded strip on the clean plate and move on to the next one. This is messy and your hands will get coated so make sure you won’t get interrupted before you begin.
step 3:
Once all of the strips are breaded, place them on a baking sheet lined with foil and bake for 20 minutes at 400 degrees. After 20 minutes, turn the oven on to broil and broil for about 5 minutes on each side. Watch the strips during the broiling process. When they get golden brown, pull them out, flip them and wait for the second side to get golden (about 5 minutes each side). Let the strips cool slightly before serving!

	unit: cup
	name: baking powder 
	amount: 1
	unit: tsp
	name: shredded coconut 
	amount: 3/4
	unit: cup
step 0:
Preheat your oven to 350 degrees. In a medium bowl, combine the flour and powdered sugar. Mix until evenly combined. Using a food processor, blend in the butter until the mixture has small granules the size of peas. If you do not have a processor (I don’t), let the butter come to room temperature and then just work it into the flour mixture with your hands. I like to call this technique “smearing it in” (yes, I made that up). See the photos below for what it should look like when thoroughly mixed.
step 1:
Lightly spray a 9×13 inch glass casserole dish with non-stick spray. Pour the flour/butter/sugar mixture evenly into the dish and press it down with your hands until it is compacted. Bake for 15 minutes.
step 2:
While the crust is baking, combine the eggs, granulated sugar, lemon juice and baking powder in a bowl (I used the same bowl). Mix it well until the sugar is dissolved. The baking powder will react with the acidic lemon juice and begin to foam, don’t worry.
step 3:
When the crust is finished baking, quickly re-whisk the filling then pour it over the crust. Sprinkle the shredded coconut on top and bake the whole thing for 20 more minutes or until it is golden brown on top. Let cool for 10 minutes before slicing.

	amount: 1

step 0:
Dice the tomatoes, jalapeno, onion, garlic and cilantro and place them in a bowl. Dice the jalapeno, onion, garlic and cilantro very finely while leaving the tomato in larger chunks (approximately 1/2 inch square). Dice the avocado about the same size as the tomatoes. Save the avocado for last to minimize the time that it is exposed to oxygen and reducing the likely hood of it turning brown. Once the dressing is mixed in, the acid from the tomatoes and lime will keep the avocado from turning brown during storage.
step 1:
In a small bowl combine the olive oil, juice and zest from the lime, salt and pepper. Pour the mixture over the diced vegetables and stir to combine!

step 0:
Preheat your oven to 400 degrees. Take one cup of frozen corn kernels out of the freezer and allow them to begin thawing.
step 1:
Empty the contents of two boxes of cornbread mix into a large bowl. Thoroughly mix 3 Tbsp of chili powder into the dry mix.
step 2:
Mix the eggs, milk and corn kernels into the dry cornbread mix. Do not over stir, just mix until the ingredients are combined. Let the mixture sit for 4-5 minutes.
step 3:
Pour the mix into a large glass casserole or muffin tin (both coated with non-stick spray). Sprinkle one cup of shredded cheese on top and bake for 20-25 minutes. The chili powder will make the muffins/bread appear much more brown on top than usual so use a toothpick to test the doneness (a toothpick inserted in the middle should come out clean, not with raw goo on it).

	unit: n/a
step 0:
Peel off the outer leaves from the cabbage. Slice the head in half and remove the core (see photos below). Cut each half into two then cut crosswise as thinly as possible. You need a very small shred to make the pot stickers easy to fill and fold.
step 1:
In a large skillet, heat 2 Tbsp of oil over medium/high heat. When it’s hot, add the cabbage and 1/2 tsp of salt. Saute the cabbage until it is translucent and soft (about 15 minutes). Remove from the heat and let cool slightly.
step 2:
While the cabbage is sauteing (stir every minute or so), combine the raw ground pork, peeled and grated ginger (use a small cheese grater), minced garlic, soy sauce, sesame oil, sliced green onion an shredded carrot. Mix them all together well with your hands. Add the shredded and cooked cabbage and mix again until it is evenly incorporated (you almost have to use your hands here). Refrigerate the mixture for at least one hour to let the flavors blend. (The cabbage will release gasses as it refrigerates and smell pretty stinky when you come back to it but don’t be afraid. It’s still good and the smell will go away when you cook the pot stickers.)
step 3:
Prepare your workspace by getting a small dish of water (used to glue the edges together), something to fold the pot stickers on (I used a cutting board) and something to keep them on once folded (another cutting board or large plate). I used square wrappers so the wrapping technique below is based on that. There are many methods to folding pot stickers/won tons so if you have a different shape, simply do a google search for “folding won tons” or “folding pot stickers” to see more methods.
step 4:
To make things easier, fill and fold the wontons in groups. I filled and folded three then moved on to the next group. Take three won ton wrappers and lay them on your surface. Using your finger, wet all the way around the edge of the wrapper. Place about 1 tsp of pork filling in the center of each square. Fold the square over diagonally from one corner to the opposite corner. Press down all along the seam to make the wet edges stick. Squeeze out all of the air in the process.
step 5:
Take the two points of the triangle that are furthest from each other and wrap them around front and pinch together (use a bit more water to glue it together). The pot sticker is now folded! Fold the rest in the same manner. Once all of the pot stickers are folded, you can either cook all of them or freeze some on a cookie sheet. Once they are completely frozen solid, transfer them to an air tight freezer bag for storage. You can take them out and cook them as usual at a later date!
step 6:
In a large pot, bring 6 cups of water and 3 bouillon cubes to a boil. Once it reaches a hard boil, drop in about half of the pot stickers. Boil them until they begin to float (about 7 minutes) then transfer to a cooling rack to drain. Place a baking sheet under the cooling rack to catch any water that drips off.
step 7:
Once the pot stickers are done boiling and have drained for a minute or two they are ready to fry. Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium/high heat. Spray it generously with non-stick spray. Using a non-stick pan with non-stick spray is the easiest way to make the pot stickers crispy without having them stick, tear and use a ton of oil. Pan fry the pot stickers on each side until golden brown and crispy (2-3 min on each side).
step 8:
Serve immediately with your favorite asian sauce (soy, oyster, teriyaki, sweet chili… anything goes!).

	unit: cups
step 0:
The night before cooking, place your beans in a large bowl and cover with double the amount of water. Let soak at room temperature over night. If you forget to do this (like I did), begin with step 1b.
step 1:
To quick soak your beans, place them in a pot with double the amount of cold water. Bring the pot to a boil with a lid and let boil for 2 minutes. Remove the beans from the heat after two minutes and let sit, tightly covered, for one hour.
step 2:
While the beans are soaking, slice the sausage. Some people like to quarter the links lengthwise, then slice to yield small triangular bits. Some like to slice them into half moons but I prefer medallions. Saute the sausage in a large pot over medium/high heat until they are cooked through and nicely browned. Remove them from the pot with a slotted spoon (leave the grease) and refrigerate until later.
step 3:
Clean and dice the onion, celery, green bell pepper and garlic. Add these to the large pot containing the sausage grease and add 1 Tbsp of vegetable oil if needed. Saute the vegetables until they are soft and transparent (about 10 minutes).
step 4:
Drain the soaking water off of the beans, rinse them then add them to the pot. Also add 7 cups of water, the bullion, bay leaves, thyme and oregano. Stir it all together well and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat slightly (medium) and boil until the beans are soft (without a lid, about one hour). If the mixture gets dry, add more water (mine had plenty but keep an eye on it).
step 5:
Once the beans are soft, use the back of a large spoon to smash about half of the beans against the side of the pot. This will give the beans a nice thick “creamy” texture. Add the sausage back into the pot and continue to boil the mixture until it is to your desired thickness (without a lid, mine took one more hour). Add Tony Chachere’s or other Cajun seasoning to your liking. The seasoning contains salt so you will probably not need to add that separately.
step 6:
During the last hour of cooking, prepare the rice. In another large pot, combine two cups of dry rice with 3.5 cups of water. Bring to a boil with a lid then reduce the heat to low and continue to cook until all of the water has absorbed (about 30 minutes).
step 7:
Serve the beans in a bowl (about 1 cup of beans & sausage) with a pile of rice on top (.5-.75 cups of rice). Top the bowl with some freshly sliced green onions.

	unit: tsp
step 0:
Peel, wash, and cut your potatoes into one inch cubes. Place them in a large pot and cover with cold water. Add 1 tsp of salt to the water and bring it to a boil over high heat. Boil the potatoes until they are tender (about ten minutes). Test the doneness by piercing the potatoes with a fork, then drain them in a colander and let them cool.
step 1:
While the potatoes are boiling, begin to hard boil the eggs. Place the eggs in a small pot and cover them with cold water, then bring the pot to a boil over high heat. If your eggs were cold (just out of the fridge), let them remain boiling for one minute before turning off the heat. If they were room temperature, turn the heat off as soon as it reaches a rolling boil. After turning off the heat, cover the pot with a lid. Let the eggs sit for exactly 15 minutes (use a timer), carefully pour out the hot water and run cool water into the pot to stop the cooking process. Adding a few ice cubes doesn't hurt either. If you don't replace the hot water with cool water the eggs will continue to cook and your yolks risk turning green.
step 2:
Rinse and finely dice the celery, and slice the green onions.
step 3:
To make the dressing, mix together the mayonnaise, mustard, pepper, relish, and red wine vinegar in a bowl. Add a 1/2 tsp Tony’s or seasoning salt, mix and taste test for more. You want the dressing heavily seasoned because it will taste diluted once mixed with the potatoes.
step 4:
Peel and dice the hard boiled eggs. Add the cooked and cooled potatoes to a large bowl along with the diced celery, sliced green onion, diced eggs, and dressing. Stir until everything is combined and coated in the dressing. If you prefer a softer, less chunky potato salad, mash the potatoes slightly.

	amount: n/a
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Cook the rice in a medium pot with 1.75 cups of water and two buillion cubes. (instructions for cooking rice here) While the rice is cooking, finely chop the cilantro. Mix the cilantro and chili powder into the rice after it has finished cooking. Set the rice aside until you are ready to use it.
step 1:
While the rice is cooking, roast the poblanos. Preheat the broiler to 400 degrees. Spray a baking sheet and coat all sides of the poblano peppers with non-stick spray (you can rub olive oil all over them but I find spraying is much easier). Place the baking sheet a few inches under the broiler (I use the second rack level) and broil on each side for 5 minutes.
step 2:
After broiling the poblanos, the skin should be blistered and bubbly. Immediately place the peppers into a ziplock bag for about 15 minutes to allow the steam to loosen the skin. Remove them from the bag and peel away as much of the skin as possible (be gentle and it is okay if you can’t get ALL of the skin).
step 3:
Cut a boat shaped piece out of each pepper and then carefully remove the seeds and seed pod. Save the pieces of pepper that are removed to make the openings because it makes a great ingredient for salads, burrito bowls or quesadillas (breakfast quesadilla anyone?).
step 4:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees (bake, not broil this time). Gently fill the peppers with layers of seasoned rice, salsa, cheese and beans. I began with rice (1/3 to 1/2 cup), then 1 Tbsp of salsa, 1/3 oz. of cheese, beans (as much as I could stuff in), then more salsa and cheese (same amounts as before).
step 5:
Place the peppers back in the oven and bake until they are heated through and the cheese is melted (about 20 minutes). Enjoy!

step 0:
Pre-heat a non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. While the skillet is warming, mix together the rice, egg, vanilla, cinnamon and salt in a bowl until well combined.
step 1:
Using a measuring cup (about 1/3 cup), scoop some of the rice mixture onto the hot skillet. Using your spatula, smoosh the ball of rice down until it is a circle and about 1/2 inch thick. Repeat until your skillet is full.
step 2:
The pancakes need to cook for about 5 minutes on each side to give the egg enough time to set and hold the rice together. Flipping them too early or too many times will result in loose fried rice rather than rice pancakes. When you flip the pancakes, make sure to get the entire pancake onto the spatula before attempting to flip. Plate the pancakes up when they are golden brown on both sides and solid in texture.
step 3:
Dress the pancakes with your favorite pancake toppings and enjoy!

	amount: 1/2
	unit: cup
step 0:
In a small non-stick skillet, fry your egg until it is set. I like to leave the yolk just slightly runny but beware: the runnier the yolk, the less portable the quesadilla (and there is nothing worse than dripping egg yolk down the front of your shirt before you even get to work. Trust me).
step 1:
While the egg cooks, smear 1 tsp of chili garlic paste on one half of the tortilla. Top that side with 1/4 cup of cheese. When the egg is finished, place the egg on top of the cheese (the heat helps it melt) and then put the spinach on top of the egg. Fold the tortilla over and return it to the pan (keep the heat on).
step 2:
Cook each side of the quessadilla until it is golden brown and crispy (1-2 min each side). Be careful not to spill the contents of the quesadilla out as you flip it. The spinach likes to escape.
step 3:
Wrap your crispy quesadilla in a paper towel and enjoy on the go!

step 0:
Saute the green onions in 1 Tbsp of butter over medium heat until they are soft (2-3 minutes). While the onions are cooking, whisk together the eggs and milk.
step 1:
Once the onions are soft, pour the egg mixture over top and let it cook (without stirring) until the edges are “set” (this means cooked/turned solid… see photos below). Once the edges are set, use your spatula to pull the edges in toward the center of the pan, letting the unset/liquid egg flow back onto the surface of the pan. Repeat this process until almost all of the egg mixture is set/cooked. Move on to the next step when the egg mixture is still moist and glistening but is mostly cooked. If you cook it until it is dry at this step, your end product will be over cooked and super dry. Yuck.
step 2:
Pour the salsa on the eggs and gently fold in (be careful not to over stir, you’ll end up with pellet like scrambled eggs). Add the tortilla strips and gently fold in. The tortilla strips will soften and reduce in volume as they are mixed in so don’t worry if your pan seems to be over flowing at first!
step 3:
Sprinkle the top of your migas with shredded cheese and freshly chopped cilantro. Serve while it is still hot and moist!

	amount: 1/2
	unit: cup
	name: sweet chili sauce 
	amount: 1
	unit: cup
step 0:
Cut off any extra fat globules from your chicken breasts. Cut each breast into 6 strips, diagonally to prevent the end strips from being really short. See photos below.
step 1:
Prepare your breading station by gathering three bowls. In the first bowl combine the flour and salt. In the second bowl, combine the eggs and coconut milk. Whisk together until well combined. In the third bowl, stir together the panko bread crumbs and shredded coconut.
step 2:
Place 1/4 cup of vegetable oil in a large heavy duty skillet and heat over medium/high heat until it is just below smoking. You can test the heat by throwing in a little bit of flour. When it is hot enough, the flour will sizzle and create a lot of bubbles.
step 3:
While the oil is heating, dredge the chicken strips. First, coat each strip in the flour and salt mixture. Then dip each into the eggs/coconut milk and finally coat each in panko and shredded coconut. I find it easiest to coat all of them in the flour then go back and then do the egg wash and panko/coconut for each before moving onto the next.
step 4:
After breading the strips, the oil should be hot enough. Place about 6 strips in the pan at once. There should only be one layer in the pan and there should be about an inch between each strip. If you over crowd the pan it will get too cold and the strips will soak up a lot of oil instead of frying. Fry the strips for 2-3 minutes on each side or until they are golden brown and crispy. Place them on a plate with paper towel to drain and move on to the next batch. After a couple of batches you may need more oil so you can add the second 1/4 cup to the pan. Allow the oil to come up to temperature before frying the next batch (2-3 minutes). Because the strips are thin, they should be cooked through by the time both sides are browned. You can tell by the texture of the chicken; it should be stiff when pressed. If you cut your strips thicker, you will need to bake off the chicken after frying to make sure the insides are cooked through.
step 5:
When all of the strips are done frying, serve immediately with sweet chili sauce to dip in. I garnished mine with a little bit of chopped cilantro.

Preheat your oven to 350 degrees. Spray a baking dish lightly with non-stick spray. Using a fork, slightly mash the Roasted Poblano and Sweet Potato Salad.
step 1:
Lay out your tortillas and divide the mashed up sweet potato mixture evenly between all four (about 1/2 cup each). Sprinkle a little bit (about 2 Tbsp) of shredded cheddar in each tortilla as well. Gently fold the sides of the tortillas in toward the center, one side over the other, until they look like fat cigars.
step 2:
Pour a little bit of enchilada sauce in the bottom of your baking dish. Place the rolled enchiladas in the baking dish, seam side down. Top the enchiladas with the rest of the sauce and the rest of the shredded cheese.
step 3:
Bake the enchiladas at 350 degrees for about 30 minutes. Enjoy!

	name: ground cumin 
	amount: 2
	unit: tsp
	name: salt 
	amount: 1/2
	unit: tsp
step 0:
Preheat your oven to 400 degrees on the broiler setting. Line a baking sheet with foil and spray your poblanos with non-stick spray. Place the baking sheet with the peppers about 4 inches below the broiler coils(this is the second rack level on my oven). Roast the peppers under the broiler for 15 minutes on one side, flip them over then broil for another 5 minutes on the other side. You want the skin on the peppers to be all blistered and blackened. This will give them a nice smokey flavor. Don’t worry, you will be peeling away the charred skin.
step 1:
While the peppers are roasting, peel the sweet potatoes and cut them into even chunks about one inch square. Place the chunks in a bowl and toss them together with 3 Tbsp of olive oil, 2 tsp of cumin, 1/2 tsp of salt and about half a bunch of chopped cilantro leaves. Mix it all up until the sweet potato chunks are well coated. The peppers should be done roasting at this point.
step 2:
When the peppers come out of the oven, put them into a resealable freezer bag and let them cool. The peppers will steam themselves in the bag as they cool allowing you to easily peel away the skin.
step 3:
Turn the oven from broil to bake (still on 400 degrees), pour out the bowl of sweet potato chunks onto the baking sheet that was used for the peppers, and roast the sweet potatoes for 30 minutes. Stir the chunks half way through.
step 4:
Drain and rinse the can of black beans. Thaw one cup of frozen corn kernels. Finely chop 1/4 of a red onion (if desired). Put the beans, corn and onion together in a bowl. When the poblanos have cooled, peel off their skin, open them up to remove the seeds, seed pod and stem then cut the flesh into chunks. Put the chopped poblanos in the bowl with the other vegetables.
step 5:
When the sweet potatoes are done, let them cool for about 10 minutes. In the mean time, chop the other half of the cilantro, and juice the lime. Mix the sweet potatoes, cilantro and lime together with the rest of the ingredients and serve. This dish can be eaten warm or cold!

	name: powdered sugar 
	amount: 1
	unit: cup
	name: medium lemon 
	amount: 1
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Preheat your oven to 350 degrees. Whip together the softened butter and granulated sugar until you get a light fluffy paste. A mixer is best for this but if you don’t have one (like me… I know, I should), you can just use a fork and a lot of elbow grease. It won’t be easy unless your butter is really soft.
step 1:
Once the butter and sugar are mixed together, add the egg, vanilla extract and ricotta. Zest the lemon and add in half of the zest, reserving the rest for garnish. Mix until all of those “wet” ingredients are well combined.
step 2:
In a separate bowl, combine the flour, salt and baking powder. Make sure they are well combined – chunks of baking powder are not delicious.
step 3:
Mix together the bowl of wet ingredients with the dry ingredients until you have a thick paste like batter. Using a spoon, drop balls of the batter onto an ungreased baking sheet two inches apart. Bake at 350 for about 15 minutes or until the tops are golden brown.
step 4:
In a small bowl prepare the glaze by combining 1 cup of powdered sugar and the juice of the lemon that you previously zested (be careful not to let the seeds drop in). Using a spoon, smear a small amount over top of the baked cookies. ENJOY!

step 0:
Rinse your mushrooms with cool water in a colander to remove any dirt and debris. Cut them in half or in quarters to make them all about equal size and set them aside. Peel and mince the two cloves of garlic and set them aside. Zest and juice the lemon and set it aside.
step 1:
In a large skillet, cook the mushrooms in half of the olive oil (2 Tbsp) until they are soft and have released most of their water (about 5 minutes). They will be smaller and a deep taupe color when they are done. There will still be juices in the pan, this is okay. See photos below
step 2:
Turn off the burner and add the lemon juice, zest, minced garlic, thyme leaves, bay leaves, 2 Tbsp olive oil, salt and pepper. To easily remove the thyme leaves from the sprigs, simply pinch the top of the sprig and pull backwards (from top to bottom) and all of the little leaves will pop right off.
step 3:
Stir the mixture well and allow to come to room temperature in a bowl. This will allow the flavors to mix and the mushrooms to marinate. Enjoy!

	unit: n/a
	name: bunch cilantro 
	amount: 1/2
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Add the dry lentils to a medium pot. Cover with water, swish to rinse, then drain off as much water as possible. Repeat this process until the water remains mostly clear. After draining off the last rinse, add four cups of water, place a lid on top, and bring the lentils to a boil over high heat. Once it reaches a boil, turn off the heat and let sit with a lid on for about 20 minutes.
step 1:
While the lentils are cooking, begin the rest of the stew. Dice the onion and mince the garlic. Sauté both in a large pot with olive oil over medium-low heat until soft and transparent.
step 2:
While the onions and garlic cook, rinse and dice the celery. Add the diced celery to the pot and continue to sauté for a few minutes more, or just until the celery begins to soften.
step 3:
Add the diced tomatoes (with juices), chili powder, cumin, turmeric, and hot sauce to the pot. Stir to combine.
step 4:
The lentils should be finished cooking at this point. Drain off as much of the cooking water as possible, then add the lentils to the pot along with the vegetable broth. Stir to combine, then allow the soup to simmer over medium-low heat for about 15 minutes. The lentils will soften and break down further as they simmer, helping to thicken the stew.
step 5:
Pull the cilantro leaves from the stems, give them a rough chop, then stir them into the stew. Squeeze the juice of the lime into the broth and stir to combine. Taste the stew and adjust the salt or hot sauce if desired.

	amount: 2
	unit: Tbsp
step 0:
Finely dice the onion and garlic. Cook in a large pot with 3 Tbsp of olive oil until very soft and slightly golden brown. I wanted to make a sweeter sauce which is why I let the onions and garlic caramelize a bit. If you don’t like sweet sauces, proceed to the next step before they get any color on them.
step 1:
Add the rest of the ingredients (crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, basil, oregano, bay leaves, brown sugar and balsamic vinegar) to the pot. Simmer on medium/low for one hour. Be careful of the splattering sauce! Leave a lid on the pot but slightly ajar to allow steam to escape but keep flying blobs of sauce from landing on your counter top.
step 2:
Taste the sauce after a half hour or so and adjust spices and seasoning to your liking. The proportions listed above yield a slightly sweet and tangy sauce. If you like savory sauces, leave out the balsamic vinegar and reduce the sugar to 1 tsp. Some sugar is usually needed to balance the high acidity of the tomatoes.

In a small bowl, stir together the grated Parmesan, chopped parsley, garlic powder, and some freshly cracked pepper (10-15 cranks of a pepper mill).
step 2:
Drizzle the olive oil over the potatoes, then sprinkle the Parmesan mix over top. Toss the potatoes in the oil and Parmesan until they are all well coated. Give the potatoes one last pinch of salt.
step 3:
Bake the potatoes in the oven for 40 minutes, or until golden brown and crispy, stirring once half way through. Total cooking time will depend on the size of the potato cubes. Serve immediately.

Rinse and drain the black beans. Drain the diced green chiles. Slice the green onions. Add the cream cheese, black beans, green chiles, green onion, hot sauce, garlic powder, and salt to a bowl. Stir together until evenly combined, then taste and adjust the salt or hot sauce to your liking.
step 1:
Stack 5 tortillas on a plate, cover with a damp paper towel, and microwave for about 20 seconds to soften (this helps prevent them from cracking when rolled). Heat a large non-stick or cast iron skillet over medium heat. Working quickly as the skillet heats, place about 2 Tbsp of the black bean filling in each tortilla then roll tightly closed.
step 2:
Once all five are filled, add about 1 Tbsp cooking oil to the skillet, give it a few seconds to heat (it should shimmer), then add the filled taquitos seam side down. Cook the taquitos on each side until brown and crispy, then transfer to a clean plate.
step 3:
Repeat the process in small batches of five, adding a little more oil to the skillet each time, until all the filling has been used (about 15 taquitos). Serve while still hot.

	name: cooked rice
	amount: 6
	unit: cups
step 0:
Preheat the oven to 400ºF. Cut the onion, bell peppers, and chicken breasts into one-inch pieces. Drain the pineapple well, reserving the juice for the sauce. Place the onion, bell pepper, chicken, and pineapple chunks on a large sheet pan in a single layer. Use two sheets, if needed, to prevent the chicken and vegetables from piling on top of each other. They need a little room to brown correctly.
step 1:
Drizzle the cooking oil over the ingredients on the sheet pan, followed by the garlic powder, ground ginger, and a pinch or two of salt and pepper. Toss the chicken, bell peppers, onions, and pineapple until they are evenly coated in oil and spices.
step 2:
Bake the chicken and vegetables in the oven for about 40 minutes, or until they are slightly browned on the edges. Stir half way through the baking time to redistribute the heat and allow excess moisture to evaporate.
step 3:
While the chicken and vegetables are baking, prepare the sauce. In a small sauce pot whisk together the reserved pineapple juice (about 1 cup), ketchup, brown sugar, vinegar, soy sauce, and cornstarch until the cornstarch is fully dissolved. Heat the mixture over medium flame, stirring often, until it begins to simmer. When it begins to simmer the cornstarch will begin to gel and thicken the sauce. Once the sauce has thickened to a glaze, remove it from the heat and set it aside until ready to use.
step 4:
When the chicken and vegetables have finished baking, remove them from the oven and pour the prepared sauce over top. Stir until everything is coated in sauce.
step 5:
Serve the sweet and sour chicken over cooked rice with sliced green onions sprinkled over top.

	unit: cup
	name: dried apricots (about 8 pieces)
	amount: 1/3
	unit: cup
step 0:
Preheat the oven to 350ºF. In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, and salt until evenly mixed.
step 1:
In a large bowl, beat together the sugar, butter, eggs, vanilla extract, almond extract, and nutmeg until the mixture is light and creamy in appearance.
step 2:
Pour the dry ingredients into the bowl of wet ingredients and stir until a soft dough forms.
step 3:
Chop the apricots into small pieces. Add the chopped apricots and sliced almonds to the bowl with the dough, then stir until they are mixed in. Save a few pieces of almond to press into the top of the biscotti.
step 4:
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Divide the dough into two equal pieces, then shape each into a flattened log, about 3 inches wide and 12 inches long. Place the logs a few inches apart on the baking sheet. Press a few pieces of almonds into the top of the dough for decoration. Bake the biscotti logs for 35 minutes in the preheated oven, or just until the edges turn golden and the top has a few cracks.
step 5:
Remove the biscotti from the oven, but don't turn it off. Let the biscotti cool for about five minutes, then carefully transfer them to a cutting board. Use a serrated knife to cut the biscotti, on an angle, into 3/4-inch wide slices. Place the slices on back on the baking sheet, cut sides up.
step 6:
Bake the sliced biscotti for about five more minutes, then flip and bake for five minutes on the second side. Allow the biscotti to cool completely before serving or packing in an air-tight container.

	amount: 1
	unit: Tbsp
step 0:
If your rice is not already cooked, begin that first and prepare the rest of the bowl ingredients as the rice cooks. You'll need 4 cups cooked rice.
step 1:
Prepare the sautéed spinach next. Heat a large skillet over medium flame and add the cooking oil. Swirl to coat the skillet, then add the fresh spinach. Sauté the spinach for a few minutes, or just until it is wilted. Drizzle the sesame oil over top and season lightly with a pinch of salt. Remove the spinach from the skillet to a clean bowl.
step 2:
Add the ground beef to the skillet used to cook the spinach. Cook the beef until fully browned, then add the chili garlic sauce, soy sauce, and brown sugar. Stir and cook for about one minute, or until everything is evenly mixed and the beef is coated in sauce. Turn the heat off.
step 3:
Prepare the fresh vegetables. Peel and grate the carrot using a large holed cheese grater. Thinly slice the cucumber, and slice the green onions.
step 4:
Fry or soft boil 4 large eggs (Or however many bowls you plan on eating immediately. If meal prepping, cook the egg fresh each day.)
step 5:
Build the bowls by first adding 1 cup cooked rice to the bowl, followed by 1/4 of the cooked spinach, 1/4 of the ground beef, some sliced cucumber, shredded carrots, a cooked egg, an a tablespoon or so of kimchi. Sprinkle sliced green onions and sesame seeds over top. There are no hard measurements needed for each ingredient per bowl, just divide the ingredients evenly or as you see fit.

cook_time: 20
num_servings: 4
ingredients:
	name: frozen broccoli florets
	amount: 1/2 
	unit: lb.
	name: rotini pasta
	amount: 1/2
	unit: lb.
	name: boneless, skinless chicken thighs (about 2/3 lb. total)
	amount: 2
	unit: n/a
	name: salt and peppers
	amount: 1
	unit: pinch
	name: olive oil
	amount: 1

	amount: 2
	unit: cloves
	name: fresh lemon
	amount: 1
	unit: n/a
	name: chicken broth
	amount: 1/2
	unit: cup
	name: heavy cream
	amount: 1
	unit: cup
step 0:
Take the broccoli florets out of the freezer and allow them to thaw. When they are soft enough to cut, chop them into smaller, bite-sized pieces. Set the broccoli aside to fully thaw until you are ready to use them.
step 1:
Bring a large pot of water to boil for the pasta. Once boiling, add the pasta and continue to boil until the pasta is tender. Drain the pasta in a colander.
step 2:
While the water for the pasta is heating, season both sides of the chicken thighs with a pinch of salt and pepper. Heat a deep skillet over medium flame, then add the olive oil. Tilt the skillet to coat the surface in oil, then add the chicken thighs. Cook the thighs on both sides until golden brown and cooked through (about 5 minutes each side). Remove the thighs to a cutting board and let rest.
step 3:
While the chicken is cooking, zest the lemon using a zester or small-holed cheese grater and mince the garlic. Once the chicken has been removed from the skillet, turn the heat down to medium-low, and add the garlic. Sauté the garlic for 1-2 minutes, or just until it is soft and fragrant.
step 4:
Add the chicken broth to the skillet and stir to dissolve all the browned bits off the bottom of the skillet. Add the heavy cream, about 1 tsp of the lemon zest, and 2 Tbsp of the lemon's juice. Stir to combine, and allow the cream to come up to a gentle simmer. Simmer the sauce for a few minutes, or until it thickens slightly. Taste the sauce and adjust the salt, pepper, or lemon if needed. Season the sauce liberally so the flavors are not diluted once combined with the pasta, broccoli, and chicken.
step 5:
Chop the cooked chicken into small pieces, then add it to the cream sauce in the skillet along with the drained pasta and chopped broccoli florets. Stir to combine and coat everything in sauce. Allow the chicken, broccoli, and pasta to heat through, then serve.

	amount: n/a
	unit: n/a
	name: split chicken breasts* (about 3 lbs. total)
	amount: 2
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Preheat the oven to 275ºF. Remove the chicken from the refrigerator and allow it to warm slightly as you prepare the butter herb mix (5 minutes or so).
step 1:
In a small bowl, stir together the butter, minced garlic, basil, thyme, rosemary, salt, and pepper. Rosemary pieces can be quite large, so either chop or crumble the dried pieces with your hands before adding them to the mix.
step 2:
Place the chicken on a cutting board and pat it dry on both sides with a clean paper towel. Smear the butter herb mixture over both sides of the chicken. Drying the meat will help the butter herb mixture stick. If the meat is too cold, it will form condensation as you rub the butter mixture over the surface and the butter will not stick.
step 3:
Place the seasoned chicken pieces in a casserole dish that is deep enough to fully contain the chicken. Cover tightly with foil, or with the dish's lid if there is one. Bake the chicken in the preheated oven for 90 minutes, basting once half way through.
step 4:
Ater 90 minutes, remove the foil, baste again, and adjust the oven's temperature to 425ºF. Bake the chicken at 425ºF for 20 minutes without the foil, or until the skin is deep golden brown and crispy. Remove the chicken from the oven and let rest for 5-10 minutes.
step 5:
Slice the breasts or pull the meat from the bone. Reserve the juices from the bottom of the casserole dish for drizzling over top of the meat.

step 0:
Remove an damaged outer leaves from the cabbage. Cut the cabbage into wedges, remove the core, then slice crosswise into thin shreds. Place the thinly shredded cabbage in a colander and sprinkle liberally with salt. Massage the salt into the cabbage and let it sit for about five minutes.
step 1:
While the cabbage is being salted, prepare the dressing by combining the oil, lemon juice, honey, sugar, Dijon, poppy seeds, onion powder, and salt in a bowl or jar. Whisk the ingredients together or place a lid on the jar and shake until it forms an emulsion (10-15 seconds).
step 2:
Rinse the cabbage well to remove the salt. Toss the cabbage in the colander as you rinse to make sure all the salt is removed. Let the excess water drain away.
step 3:
Once the cabbage is rinsed and drained, add it to a bowl with the chopped chicken, sliced almonds, dried cranberries, and sliced green onions. Give the dressing a quick stir, then pour it over the salad. Toss the salad until everything is evenly mixed and coated in dressing. Let marinate 5-10 minutes before serving.

	name: whole milk
	amount: 1/2
	unit: cup
	name: Salt and pepper to taste
	amount: n/a
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Wash, peel, and cut the potatoes into one-inch cubes. Place the potatoes in a large pot, cover with water, and bring to a boil. Boil the potatoes until they are very tender and fall apart when pierced with a fork (about 10 minutes). Drain the potatoes in a colander.
step 1:
While the potatoes are cooking, prepare the cabbage. Remove any damaged outer leaves, then cut it in half. Cut the cabbage into quarters, then remove the core. Cut each of the two quarters used in half once again, then cut crosswise into thin strips. Wash the cabbage well to remove any dirt or debris. Also mince the garlic and slice the green onions.
step 2:
After removing the potatoes from the pot, add 4 Tbsp butter, the minced garlic, and the sliced green onions (I reserved a few to sprinkle over top at the end). Sauté the garlic and onions over medium heat for 1-2 minutes, or just until the garlic begins to soften.
step 3:
Add the shredded cabbage and chicken broth to the pot. Place a lid on top and let the broth come up to a boil. Let the cabbage cook in the simmering broth, stirring every few minutes, until it has wilted and become tender. The volume of the cabbage will shrink quite a bit as it cooks. Cook until the thicker white pieces begin to become transparent (about 10-12 minutes).
step 4:
Once the cabbage is tender, add the drained potatoes back to the pot along with the milk and some freshly cracked pepper. Mash the potatoes until everything is well combined. Season with salt to taste. Serve warm.

step 0:
Remove the tofu from the package and wrap it in a clean, lint-free towel, or paper towels. Place the wrapped tofu between two cutting boards or plates, and place something heavy on top (books, a pot of water, etc.). Press the tofu for about 30 minutes to extract the excess moisture.
step 1:
While the tofu is pressing, prepare the stir fry sauce. In a small bowl, stir together the soy sauce, sesame oil, sriracha, rice vinegar, and curry powder. Set the sauce aside.
step 2:
Place the rice noodles in a casserole dish or large bowl and pour boiling water over top. Let the noodles soak for about 5 minutes, or until soft. Drain the noodles in a colander and set them aside until needed.
step 3:
Once the tofu has pressed, cut it into small cubes (3/4 to 1-inch). Place the cubes in a bowl and season with a pinch of salt. Sprinkle the cornstarch over top and gently toss until the cubes are coated.
step 4:
Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add one to 1.5 Tbsp cooking oil and tilt the skillet to distribute it over the surface. Add the cornstarch coated tofu cubes and cook until golden brown and crispy on all sides. Remove the tofu from the skillet.
step 5:
While the tofu is cooking, mince the garlic and grate the ginger. Slice the green onions, separating the white ends from the green ends.
step 6:
After removing the tofu from the skillet, add a bit more cooking oil along with the ginger, garlic, and the white ends of the sliced green onions. Sauté for about one minute, or just until they begin to soften.
step 7:
Add the bag of shredded cabbage and carrots and continue to sauté for about one minute more. Only sauté the cabbage until it looks like it's just beginning to wilt.
step 8:
Add the drained rice noodles, prepared sauce, and fried tofu cubes back to the skillet. Carefully stir and toss the contents of the skillet until everything is combined and coated with sauce. Turn off the heat and sprinkle the green ends of the green onions over top.

	amount: 1/4
	unit: tsp
step 0:
Preheat the oven to 325ºF. In a large bowl, stir together the coconut, sugar, flour, and salt.
step 1:
Separate the white and yolks of four large eggs. Save the yolks for another use and pour the whites into the bowl with the coconut. Use a large spatula to stir until everything is evenly mixed.
step 2:
Add the vanilla and almond extract to the coconut mixture. Use a small-holed cheese grater or zester to zest the orange straight into the bowl (to catch all the fragrant oils). Stir the mixture until the extracts and orange zest are evenly incorporated. There should be no liquid on the bottom of the bowl. Add more coconut, as needed, to make sure the thick mixture evenly coats the coconut and does not drip to the bottom of the bowl.
step 3:
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Scoop the coconut mixture into heaping tablespoons onto the baking sheet, 1-2 inches apart. Bake the cookies for about 20 minutes, or until the edges begin to brown slightly. Remove the macaroons from the oven and allow them to cool.
step 4:
While the macaroons are cooling, place the chocolate and coconut oil in a small bowl. Microwave in 20 second intervals, stirring well in between, until the chocolate is melted. Drizzle the chocolate over the cooled macaroons and let sit until the chocolate has cooled and set.

Slice the onion into thin strips. Rinse the portobello caps to remove any dirt or debris. Slice each cap in half, then crosswise into 1/4-inch thick strips.
step 1:
Add the butter to a deep skillet along with the sliced onions. Sauté the onions over medium heat for a few minutes, or just until they begin to soften. Add the sliced mushrooms, a pinch of salt and pepper, the thyme, and oregano. Sauté the mushrooms until they release all their moisture and the liquid in the bottom of the skillet has dried up (about 10 minutes). You want to see some of the liquid browning and coating the bottom of the skillet (but not burning).
step 2:
Once the evaporated juices begin to coat the bottom of the skillet, pour in the vegetable broth. Stir to dissolve the browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. Also add the soy sauce, brown sugar, and garlic powder. Allow the liquid to come up to a simmer, then turn down to low and simmer for about 5 minutes while you toast the bread.
step 3:
Open the rolls and place them on a baking sheet, open sides up. Turn the oven on to broil and place the rolls in the oven. Watch the rolls closely and broil just until you see a slightly browning on the edges (about 5 minutes).
step 4:
Use a slotted spoon or tongs to take the mushrooms and onions out of the au jus. Divide the mushrooms and onions among the four rolls. Top each sandwich with a slice of provolone. Return the sandwiches to the oven and broil for a few minutes more, or just until the cheese is melted. Close the sandwiches up and serve with the au jus from the skillet for dipping.

step 0:
Drain the diced tomatoes. In a medium bowl, combine the drained tomatoes with the olive oil, lemon juice, minced garlic, oregano, salt, and some freshly cracked pepper. Stir well, then set the tomato mixture aside. Preheat the oven to 400ºF.
step 1:
Place the chicken breasts on a cutting board and cover them with a sheet of plastic wrap. Use a mallet or rolling pin to carefully pound the chicken breasts to an even thickness. Don't pound with too much force or the breasts may split. Start at the thickest part of the breast and work your way out toward the edges. Once pounded, slice each chicken breast into two portions and season each side with a pinch of salt and pepper.
step 2:
Drain the can of artichoke hearts and roughly chop them into smaller, bite-sized pieces. Place a handful of the artichoke pieces in the bottom of a casserole dish, then lay the chicken pieces over top. Cover the chicken with the remaining artichoke pieces. Pour the tomato mixture over top.
step 3:
Bake the chicken, uncovered, in the fully preheated oven for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, sprinkle one cup of mozzarella over top. Switch oven's setting from bake to broil and broil the dish (on the middle rack) for about 5 minutes or until the cheese is bubbly and browned. Serve immediately.

step 1:
In a large skillet, sauté the sweet potato, poblano, and garlic in vegetable oil over medium heat until they begin to soften (about 5-7 minutes). Squeeze the chorizo out of it’s casing into the skillet. Continue to sauté over medium heat, breaking up the chorizo into pieces as you stir, until the chorizo is cooked through (5-7 minutes more).
step 2:
Spray a large casserole dish with non-stick spray and preheat the oven to 375ºF. Scoop about 1/2 cup of the chorizo sweet potato filling into each tortilla, then roll into a cigar shape. Place the filled and rolled tortillas in the baking dish, seam side down. They should fill the dish and fit tightly against each other to prevent unrolling.
step 3:
Pour the enchilada sauce over the the rolled tortillas and top with shredded cheese. Bake in the oven until the edges begin to bubble (about 20-25 minutes). Top with sliced green onions after baking. Serve hot.

	unit: Tbsp
	name: vanilla extract 
	amount: 1/2
	unit: tsp
	name: milk 
	amount: 2
	unit: Tbsp
step 0:
In a large bowl stir together the flour, salt, sugar, and baking powder until evenly combined. Pour in the heavy whipping cream and stir until a dough forms.
step 1:
Dust a clean work surface with flour and turn the dough out onto the surface. Work the dough slightly, if needed, to make it cohesive, smooth, and evenly mixed. Avoid kneading the dough. Form the dough into a small rectangle with your hands, then use a rolling pin to flatten and enlarge the dough into a 9x16" rectangle. Make sure the work surface is well floured as you roll to prevent the dough from sticking.
step 2:
Begin to preheat the oven to 400ºF. To make the chocolate cinnamon filling, place the butter in a bowl and microwave for 30 seconds. Stir and then heat more, in 15 second intervals, until completely melted. Stir in the brown sugar and cinnamon. Spread the cinnamon sugar mixture over the surface of the rolled dough, from edge to edge. Sprinkle the chocolate chips on top of the cinnamon sugar mixture.
step 3:
Roll the dough up, working from one long side to the other, so you have a 16" long roll. Use a very sharp knife, thread, or floss to cut the roll into 12 equal sized pieces. Coat the inside of a casserole dish or pie plate with non-stick spray (or butter), then arrange the cut chocolate cinnamon buns in the dish. The pieces should be close and touching slightly, but not squeezed together.
step 4:
Bake the buns for 20-25 minutes, or until they are golden brown on top (the total cooking time will depend on the dish and how many buns you're cooking at once). Allow the buns to cool.
step 5:
While cooling, prepare the chocolate glaze. Place the powdered sugar in a bowl and add the cocoa powder, vanilla extract, and milk. Stir the ingredients until they form a thick, chocolatey glaze. Once the buns are mostly cooled, drizzle the glaze over top and enjoy.

	amount: 1
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Allow the broccoli florets to thaw, then chop them into very small pieces. Preheat the oven to 425ºF. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
step 1:
Place the chilled leftover mashed potatoes in a large bowl, along with the chopped broccoli, cheddar shreds, garlic powder, smoked paprika, and salt. Stir until everything is evenly combined. Taste the mixture and adjust the salt or spices if needed.
step 2:
Briefly whisk the egg in a small bowl, then add it to the mashed potato mixture. Stir until it is fully incorporated into the mashed potatoes. Using your hands, take about one to one and a half tablespoons of the potato mixture at a time and roll them into small tots. The mixture will be wet, but not very sticky. You may need to rinse your hands once or twice during the process. The mixture should make 50-60 tots.
step 3:
Once rolled, bake the tots for 35 minutes, rolling them twice throughout to achieve even browning (roll at 15 minutes, then at 25 minutes). Use a fork to help you roll each tot over. Serve the tots immediately after baking.

step 0:
To make the vinaigrette, mince the garlic and add it to a small bowl with the olive oil, vinegar, Dijon, salt, sugar, and freshly cracked pepper. Whisk the ingredients together until the dressing becomes light and almost creamy in appearance. Set the dressing aside to allow the flavors to blend.
step 1:
Place the dried cranberries in a small bowl and add very hot water. Let the cranberries soak for about five minutes, or until they soften slightly. Drain the cranberries and set them aside. Slice the pear into thin strips.
step 2:
Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add 1/2 Tbsp olive oil and tilt the pan until it is covered. Add the shredded Brussels sprouts and sauté them until they begin to soften, but are still bright green (about 5 minutes). Remove them from the heat and season with salt and pepper. They will continue to soften from the residual heat in the skillet.
step 3:
Add the pear slices and cranberries to the wilted Brussels sprouts. Drizzle some of the dressing over the salad and toss to combine. Add more dressing as needed. Finish with a final pinch of freshly cracked pepper.

	unit: Tbsp
	name: vanilla extract
	amount: 1
	unit: tsp
	name: pecan pieces
	amount: 2/3
	unit: cup
step 0:
Preheat the oven to 350ºF. Beat together the butter and cream cheese in a large mixing bowl. Once combined, add 1 cup flour the sugar, and beat again until combined. The mixture may look dry and crumbly, but should stick together when squeezed with your hands. Form the mixture into a ball, adding an extra tablespoon or two of flour if it becomes too sticky.
step 1:
Divide the dough into 12 equal pieces. The easiest way to do this is to first divide the dough into four equal-sized pieces, then divide each of those into three. Roll each piece into a ball, then place each one in the well of a regular-sized muffin tin (NOT a mini muffin tin). The muffin tin does not need to be greased.
step 2:
Use your fingers to press the dough balls into the bottom and up the sides of the muffin tin wells. It's okay if the dough does not reach the very top of the well. Make sure to press it deep into the corners, to avoid rounded thick corners. Place a dime-sized piece of chocolate into each of the shaped pie crusts. I used about 50 grams of the chocolate in the bottom of the pies, and the rest was used to drizzle on top after baking.
step 3:
To make the filling, add the beaten egg, brown sugar, melted butter, vanilla, and pecans in a small mixing bowl. Stir to combine, avoiding beating the mixture too much or causing frothy air bubbles. 
step 4:
Spoon the mixture evenly between each of the pie crusts. The filling will only fill each pie crust about half way, but will puff up as it bakes. Once filled, place the muffin tin in the preheated oven and bake for 30 minutes.
step 5:
Once the pies are baked, melt the remaining 25 grams of chocolate. You can melt it using a microwave, heating for 15 seconds at a time and stirring well after each heating, until melted, or by placing a small bowl over a double boiler. Once melted, drizzle the chocolate over each pie. 
step 6:
Allow the pies to cool completely, then use a small knife to gently lift them out of the muffin tin.

step 0:
To prepare the coleslaw dressing, mix together the mayonnaise, honey, Dijon, red wine vinegar, salt, and some freshly cracked pepper in a bowl. Place the coleslaw mix and sliced green onions in a bowl and add about 3/4 of the dressing. Stir until everything is coated in dressing, then add more dressing if desired. Refrigerate the slaw until ready to serve.
step 1:
To prepare the smoky garlic lime sauce, stir together the mayonnaise, garlic powder, smoked paprika, and the juice from half a lime (about 1 Tbsp) in a small bowl. Save the other half of the lime to serve as wedges with the finished tacos.
step 2:
Heat a dry skillet over medium heat. Once the skillet is hot, toast the tortillas on each side until browned on the edges. Place the toasted tortillas on stacked on a plate and covered with a towel until ready to serve.
step 3:
Prepare the blackening seasoning by stirring together the smoked paprika, thyme, oregano, cumin, cayenne, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and freshly cracked pepper in a bowl. Pour the seasoning over the shrimp and stir until the shrimp are coated.
step 4:
Add the butter and minced garlic to a large skillet. Cook over medium heat for about one minute, or until the garlic is fragrant and slightly softened. Add the seasoned shrimp and sauté just until the shrimp is firm (about 3-5 minutes). Remove the skillet from the heat to prevent over cooking the shrimp.
step 5:
To serve the tacos, place about 1/4 cup coleslaw in each tortilla, top with 3 shrimp, a drizzle of the smoky garlic lime sauce, and a few sliced green onions. Squeeze a wedge of fresh lime over top.

	amount: 1/2
	unit: tsp
step 0:
Peel and chop the potatoes into 1-inch cubes. Rinse them in a colander with cool water, then place them in a pot and add enough fresh water to cover them completely. Add 1/2 tsp salt, place a lid on the pot, and bring it up to a boil over high heat. Boil the potatoes until very tender, about 7-10 minutes.
step 1:
Drain the potatoes in a colander and rinse them again briefly with hot water. This removes excess starch and helps give the mashed potatoes a light and fluffy texture.
step 2:
While the potatoes are draining, add the butter and milk to the pot used to boil the potatoes. Heat the butter and milk over low until the butter is melted and the milk is hot. Add the drained potatoes back to the pot, then mash until smooth. Taste and add salt to taste (about 1/2 tsp). Stir in the shredded cheddar. Set the potatoes aside until you're ready to assemble the casserole.
step 3:
While the potatoes are cooking, begin to preheat the oven to 350ºF and begin the filling for the cottage pie. Dice the onion and mince the garlic. Add the onion and garlic to a large skillet along with the olive oil and sauté over medium until the onions are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.
step 4:
Add the beef to the skillet and continue to sauté until the beef is fully cooked. Add the all-purpose flour and continue to stir and cook for about 2 minutes more, or until the flour coats the bottom of the skillet. 
step 5:
Add the beef broth and stir to dissolve the flour from the bottom of the skillet. The broth will come up to a simmer fairly quickly, at which point it will thicken into a gravy.
step 6:
Add the Worcestershire sauce, rosemary, thyme, frozen peas and carrots, and frozen corn to the skillet. Heat through, then taste and add salt if needed (I added 1/2 tsp).
step 7:
Finally, assemble the cottage pie by transferring the beef and vegetable mixture to the bottom of a 2 quart casserole dish (mine was 9"x11"). Top with dollops of the warm cheesy mashed potatoes, spreading it out smooth to cover the surface.
step 8:
Bake the Cheesy Cottage Pie for 30 minutes in the preheated 350ºF oven. If you want extra browning on top, switch the oven to broil after baking and allow it to broil for a few minutes or until the desired browning has been achieved. Let the casserole rest for 5-10 minutes before serving.

	amount: 1
	unit: n/a
	name: chili powder
	amount: 3/4 
	unit: tsp
	name: cumin
	amount: 1/4
	unit: tsp
	name: garlic powder
	amount: 1/8
	unit: tsp
	name: salt

	name: sour cream
	amount: 1/2
	unit: cup
	name: 8-inch flour tortillas
	amount: 4
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Place the chicken breast on a cutting board and cover with a piece of plastic wrap. Use a rolling pin or mallet to briefly pound the chicken breast to an even thickness (this should only take 15-20 seconds). This will help it cook quickly and evenly without drying out.
step 1:
Combine the chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, and salt in a small bowl. Sprinkle the spice mixture over both sides of the chicken breast.
step 2:
Heat the cooking oil in a skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add the chicken breast and cook on each side until cooked through (about 5 minutes each side, use a thermometer to make sure the internal temperature reaches 165ºF). Allow the chicken to cool for 5 minutes on a clean cutting board, then chop into tiny pieces.
step 3:
While the chicken is cooking, roughly chop the spinach into smaller pieces. Add the chopped chicken, spinach, cheese, and sour cream in a bowl and stir until evenly combined.
step 4:
Divide the filling between four tortillas, then fold the tortillas closed. Place the quesadillas (one or two at a time) in a skillet* over medium heat. Cook on each side until the tortillas are brown and crispy, and the filling is melted (3-5 minutes each side). Slice each quesadilla in half and serve.

	unit: n/a
step 0:
Add 2 Tbsp butter to a large skillet and place over medium heat. Once the butter is melted and sizzling add the frozen seafood mix. Stir and cook until the shrimp have turned pink and opaque (3-5 minutes). Be careful not to overcook the seafood. It should still be soft and supple. Remove the seafood from the skillet to a clean bowl and set it aside.
step 1:
Mince the garlic and add it to the skillet with two additional tablespoons butter. Sauté the garlic in the butter and the juices from the seafood for 1-2 minutes, or just until it has softened and becomes very fragrant.
step 2:
Add the can of whole peeled tomatoes with their juices and 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes (optional). Use a spatula or spoon to break the tomatoes into pieces. Let the skillet come up to a simmer over medium heat, then turn the heat down to meidum-low. Continue to simmer the skillet, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes. Continue to break the tomatoes into smaller bits every time you stir.
step 3:
After simmering the sauce for about 15 minutes, bring a large pot of water to a boil for the pasta. Cook the pasta in the boiling water for 7-10 minutes, or until al dente. Drain the pasta in a colander.
step 4:
Once the sauce is finished simmering, add 1/2 tsp of salt. Stir to combine, taste, and adjust the salt more if needed.
step 5:
Add the cooked seafood back to the skillet along with any juices that may have accumulated in the bowl. Also add the cooked and drained pasta. Toss the pasta and seafood in the sauce until everything is evenly coated. Top the pasta with a handful of chopped fresh parsley, if desired.

step 0:
Dice the onion and mince the garlic. Cook both in a large pot with the olive oil over medium heat for 2-3 minutes, or until they begin to soften. Add the ground beef and continue to cook until the beef is fully browned.
step 1:
Add the chili powder, cumin, oregano, diced tomatoes, and diced green chiles (do not drain the tomatoes or chiles). Stir to combine with the beef.
step 2:
Add the noodles and beef broth. Stir to combine and push the noodles down until they are mostly submerged under the broth. Place a lid on the pot and allow it to come up to a simmer. When it begins to simmer heavily, turn the heat down slightly (just above low) and allow it to continue simmering for 10 minutes. Stir every few minutes to keep the pasta from sticking to the bottom of the pot.
step 3:
After about ten minutes the pasta should be fully cooked and most of the broth absorbed. If it is still slightly watery, let it continue to cook for a minute or two without the lid. Taste the pasta and if it is not spicy enough for you, add the cayenne pepper.
step 4:
Drain the can of black olives and stir them into the pasta. Add the cheese and stir it in until it is fully melted. Slice the green onions, sprinkle over top, and serve.

After ten minutes of simmering, the noodles should be tender and most of the liquid absorbed. Stir the skillet well, then add the sour cream and stir until it has fully coated the pasta. Stir in most of the sliced green onions and cilantro, reserving a little to sprinkle over top.
step 4:
Sprinkle the shredded cheese over the skillet, place the lid back on top, and let the residual heat melt the cheese. Once melted, add the remaining green onions and cilantro to the top of the pasta. Serve hot.

step 0:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Line a baking sheet with foil and then spritz lightly with non-stick spray. Lightly brush off any dirt or debris from the portobella mushrooms and then drizzle each cap with 1/2 tablespoon of olive oil, 1/2 tablespoon of red wine vinegar, and a slight sprinkle of salt and pepper (both sides). Place the seasoned mushrooms on the prepared baking sheet (gill side down) and roast in the preheated oven for 30 minutes.
step 1:
While the mushrooms are roasting, begin to boil a large pot of water to cook the pasta. Once the water reaches a full boil, add the pasta and continue to boil for 7-10 minutes or until tender. Reserve about a cup of the starchy cooking water before draining the pasta in a colander.
step 2:
Mince the garlic and add it to a large skillet along with the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil and the dried thyme. Cook the garlic and thyme over medium-low heat for 2-3 minutes, or until the garlic is tender. Remove the skillet from the heat. Roughly chop the parsley.
step 3:
When the mushrooms have finished roasting, carefully cut each cap in half and then slice crosswise into thin strips. Add the drained pasta, sliced mushrooms, and chopped parsley to the skillet with the garlic (heat turned off). Toss to coat. Use a small amount of the reserved pasta water to loosen the pasta if it becomes dry. Add the parmesan cheese and toss to coat once again. If desired, add an extra splash of red wine vinegar before serving

step 0:
Rinse the parsley well to remove any dirt or debris, then pat it dry with a clean, lint-free towel. Cut off the ends of the parsley stems and place the rest, leaves and stems, in the bowl of a food processor.
step 1:
Zest and juice the lemon. Add half of the zest and about 2 Tbsp of the juice to the food processor, along with the Parmesan, garlic cloves (peeled), and some freshly cracked pepper (about 15 cranks of a pepper mill). 
step 2:
Pulse the mixture until everything is finely minced and combined. Begin to add the olive oil in a thin stream through the chute of the processor as it blend the mixture together. Once the oil has been incorporated, add salt to taste. I added about 1/4 tsp salt.
step 3:
Bring a pot of water to a boil for the pasta. Once boiling, add the pasta and continue to boil until the pasta is al dente. At the very end of the cook time, add the frozen peas and stir to combine. Let the peas sit in the hot water with the pasta for about a minute, then drain the pasta and peas in a colander.
step 4:
Allow the pasta to cool just to the point where it is no longer steaming heavily. Transfer the drained pasta to a bowl and add the parsley pesto. Stir to combine, then serve warm. Add a pinch of the remaining lemon zest over top of each serving.

	unit: Tbsp
	name: water
	amount: 1/2
	unit: cup
step 0:
To make the marinade, stir together the soy sauce, brown sugar, minced garlic, grated ginger, and water. Pour this mixture over your meat, tofu, or fish and marinate for 15-30 minutes, depending on the item.
step 1:
To make the sauce, stir together the soy sauce, brown sugar, minced garlic, grated ginger, water, AND add an additional 1/2 cup water and 1 Tbsp cornstarch. (Do not turn used marinade into a sauce. Rather, make separate batches to prevent cross contamination.) Bring this mixture up to a simmer in a small sauce pot over medium heat, while whisking. Once it reaches a simmer, it will thicken into a shiny sauce. Pour or brush the sauce over your cooked meat, vegetables, or tofu. 
step 2:
To use as a stir fry sauce, stir together all of the ingredients in a bowl. Once your stir fry meat or vegetables are cooked, pour the sauce mixture directly into your hot stir fry pan instead of simmering separately in a sauce pot. The heat from the pan will simmer the sauce on contact and thicken the sauce (make sure the stir fry pan is very hot). Stir to coat your cooked vegetables or meat.

	amount: n/a
	unit: n/a
	name: sugar 
	amount: 1
	unit: Tbsp
step 0:
Before you begin, prepare the meat and vegetables for stir frying. Peel the ginger with either a vegetable peeler or the side of a spoon and then grate it with a cheese grater. Peel and grate the carrots with a large holed cheese grater. Remove the core from the cabbage and cut into thin strips. Slice the onion into thin strips. Cut the broccoli into bite-sized pieces. Slice the chicken into thin strips.
step 1:
Begin boiling a medium pot full of water for the noodles. Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, add the grated ginger, saute for about 30 seconds to one minute (its okay if it sticks to the pan but don’t let it burn). Add the chicken strips and cook until they are no longer pink (about five minutes).
step 2:
Once the chicken is cooked through, add all of the vegetables. Stir and cook until wilted (about 5-10 minutes). Meanwhile, once the water boils, add the noodles and cook just until tender (2-3 minutes). Drain, return to the pot (with the heat turned off) and toss with the sesame oil to keep from sticking.
step 3:
In a small bowl, combine the soy sauce, worcestershire sauce, ketchup, sriracha, and sugar. Use only 1/2 tsp of sriracha if you don’t want it spicy, use up to 1 Tbsp if you like it hot. Stir until the ketchup and sugar are dissolved. Pour the sauce into the skillet with the chicken and vegetables with the heat still on medium high. Add the noodles, stir to coat everything in the sauce, and heat through (just a few minutes).

	unit: n/a
step 0:
Place the chicken on a cutting board and cover with a sheet of plastic to prevent splatter. Use a mallet or rolling pin to gently pound the chicken out to an even thickness (about 3/4-inch thick). Slice each chicken breast in half to create two pieces each. Or, use thin sliced chicken breast filets. Season the breasts with a pinch of salt and pepper.
step 1:
Heat the cooking oil in a large skillet over medium. Once hot, swirl the oil to coat the surface of the skillet. Add the chicken breasts and cook until golden brown on each side and cooked through (5-7 minutes each side).
step 2:
While the chicken is cooking, roughly chop the spinach into smaller pieces. Drain the artichoke hearts and roughly chop them as well. Mince the garlic.
step 3:
Once the chicken is cooked through, remove it to a clean plate and cover to keep warm. Add the butter and minced garlic to the skillet and continue to sauté over medium for one minute or just until the garlic begins to soften.
step 4:
Add the chicken broth to the skillet and stir to dissolve the browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. Cut the cream cheese into chunks and add it to the skillet along with the sour cream. Whisk the ingredients together and continue to cook over medium, whisking continuously, until the cream cheese is fully melted and the sauce is smooth. Add the milk and stir until smooth again.
step 5:
Add the Parmesan, a pinch of red pepper flakes, and some freshly ground pepper to the skillet. Continue to heat and whisk for a couple minutes more. Finally, stir the spinach into the sauce, a handful or two at a time, until wilted (this should only take about a minute), then stir in the artichoke hearts.
step 6:
Return the chicken to the skillet and spoon the creamy spinach artichoke sauce over top. Serve hot.

	name: cooked rice for serving
	amount: 4
	unit: cups
step 0:
Pat the chicken dry with a paper towel. Place the chicken on a cutting board and cover it with a piece of plastic wrap. Use a mallet or rolling pin to gently pound the chicken to an even thickness (about 1/2-inch thick). This step is very important to make sure the chicken cooks quickly and evenly, without drying out.
step 1:
Combine the chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, and salt in a small bowl. Sprinkle the spices over both sides of the chicken, and then rub it over the surface to make sure it's evenly coated.
step 2:
Heat a large deep skillet over medium heat. Add the cooking oil and swirl to coat the surface. Once the skillet is very hot, add the chicken and cook on both sides until browned and cooked through (about 5 minutes each side. Cooking time will vary with the size of your chicken pieces and type of cookware). 
step 3:
While the chicken is cooking, rinse and drain the black beans. Roughly chop the cilantro or slice the green onions, depending on which you prefer to use.
step 4:
Transfer the cooked chicken to a clean cutting board and let it rest while you prepare the creamy salsa. Turn the burner down to medium low. Pour the salsa into the skillet and stir to dissolve the browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. Add the black beans and frozen corn kernels and allow the sauce to heat through.
step 5:
To prevent the sour cream from curdling when added to the salsa, first add a few spoonfuls, one at a time, to the sour cream to slowly increase it's temperature and acidity. Once the sour cream is slightly warm, add it back to the rest of the salsa in the skillet and stir to combine. Turn the heat off.
step 6:
Slice the chicken breast into strips, then place it on top of the creamy salsa sauce in the skillet. Top the skillet with crumbled cheese and cilantro or green onion. Serve over a bed of cooked rice.

	name: pepper
	amount: n/a
	unit: n/a
	name: ranch dressing
	amount: 1/2
	unit: cup
step 0:
Prepare the Roasted Vegetable Couscous first. Preheat the oven to 400ºF. Chop the Roma tomatoes, zucchini, and bell pepper into 1-inch pieces. Slice the red onion into 1/2-inch thick strips. Place the tomatoes, zucchini, bell pepper, onion, and peeled garlic on a large baking sheet.
step 1:
Drizzle the olive oil over the chopped vegetables, toss to coat, then season with a couple pinches of salt and pepper. Roast the vegetables for about 45 minutes, stirring every 15 minutes or so.
step 2:
While the vegetables are roasting, begin the couscous. Bring the vegetable broth to a boil in a small sauce pot. Once boiling, stir in the couscous. Place a lid on top, remove the pot from the heat, and let the couscous sit for five minutes, or until all of the broth is absorbed. Fluff the couscous with a fork, then place in the refrigerator to begin cooling as you prepare the rest of the meal.
step 3:
While the couscous is chilling, begin the garlic herb baked chicken. Combine the room temperature butter with the parsley, oregano, basil, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Stir until it forms a paste.
step 4:
If the chicken breasts are thick, gently pound them with a mallet or rolling pin until they are an even thickness, no more than 3/4-inch thick (I cover the chicken with plastic to prevent splatter when pounding). Pat the chicken dry, then smear the butter herb mixture over the entire surface.
step 5:
Place the seasoned chicken in a baking dish and bake for 20 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 165ºF. Let the chicken rest for 5 minutes, then slice into strips.
step 6:
To make Garlic Herb Chickpeas instead, rinse and drain 2 15oz. cans of chickpeas. Heat 1 Tbsp oil in a large skillet over medium. Once hot, add the chickpeas, and sauté for about 5 minutes, or until the chickpeas are golden and the skins are blistered. Remove them from heat and then season with the same garlic herb spices used for the chicken (no butter). Stir until the chickpeas are coated in the herbs and spices.

step 8:
Divide the Roasted Vegetable Couscous between four containers and top with sliced chicken or 1/4 of the Garlic Herb Chickpeas. Serve each portion with 2 Tbsp ranch dressing.

	amount: 12
	unit: oz
	name: garlic, minced
	amount: 2

	name: all-purpose flour 
	amount: 3

	name: half and half 
	amount: 1/2
	unit: cup
	name: Salt and pepper to taste 
	amount: n/a
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Wash the mushrooms to remove any dirt or debris, then thinly slice them.
step 1:
Begin cooking the fettuccine according to the package directions. Cook the pasta just until al dente, then drain in a colander. The pasta will continue to soften slightly once it's in the creamy mushroom herb sauce, so do not overcook it.
step 2:
While the pasta is cooking, add the butter and minced garlic to a large skillet. Sauté the garlic over medium heat for 1-2 minutes, or just until fragrant and tender. Do not let the butter or garlic turn brown.
step 3:
Add the sliced mushrooms and continue to cook until the mushrooms have turned dark brown and all of the moisture they release has evaporated (5-7 minutes). Turn the heat down slightly to medium-low, add the flour, and continue to sauté until the flour begins to coat the bottom of the skillet and turns golden brown (about 2-3 minutes).
step 4:
Whisk the vegetable broth into the skillet with the flour and mushrooms. Whisk until all the flour has dissolved off the bottom of the skillet. Add the thyme, sage, and some freshly cracked pepper. Turn the heat up to medium and allow the sauce to come to a simmer, at which point it will thicken.
step 5:
Stir the half and half into the sauce and allow it to return to a gentle simmer. Taste the sauce and adjust the salt or pepper as needed (the amount of salt needed will depend on the type of broth used. I added approximately 1/4 tsp).
step 6:
Add the drained pasta to the sauce in the skillet. Toss to coat and allow the pasta to heat through over medium-low heat. The pasta will absorb some of the liquid and flavors, and further thicken the sauce. Serve hot.

step 0:
Cook the lentils according to the package directions. For most brown lentils, bring 3 cups of water to boil in a pot, add the lentils, then continue to boil for 20 minutes, or until the lentils are tender. Drain the lentils in a colander and rinse briefly with cool water until they are cooled.
step 1:
While the lentils are cooking, prepare the lemon garlic dressing. Use a microplane, zester, or small-holed cheese grater to remove about 1 Tbsp of the lemon's zest (the thin, yellow, outer layer of the peel). Set the zest aside. Juice the lemon and measure 1/4 cup of the juice to use for the dressing. In a small bowl, whisk together the lemon juice, olive oil, minced garlic, oregano, salt, and some freshly cracked pepper. Set the dressing aside.
step 2:
Rinse the parsley well, shake off as much water as possible, then pull the leaves from the stems. Roughly chop the parsley leaves. Cut the grape tomatoes in half. Finely dice the red onion.
step 3:
When the lentils are cooked, cooled, and well drained, transfer them to a large bowl. Add the chopped parsley, tomatoes, red onion, crumbled feta, lemon zest, and the prepared dressing. Stir to combine the ingredients and coat everything in dressing.
step 4:
Serve immediately, or refrigerate until ready to eat. Always stir the salad just before serving to redistribute the dressing and flavors.

Place a lid on the skillet, turn the heat up to medium-high, and allow the water to come to a full boil. Once boiling, turn the heat down to low and let it simmer for 10 minutes.
step 4:
While the skillet is simmering over low, prepare the teriyaki sauce. In a small bowl, stir together the soy sauce, brown sugar, and toasted sesame oil. The brown sugar may not fully dissolve, but that's okay. Set the sauce aside.
step 5:
After the rice has simmered for 10 minutes, lift the lid briefly to sprinkle the frozen vegetables on top, then replace the lid immediately. Make sure the vegetables are spread evenly over the surface. Let the skillet continue to heat over low for an additional five minute.
step 6:
After steaming the rice and vegetables together for 5 minutes, turn the heat off and let the skillet rest with the lid in place for an additional five minutes.
step 7:
Give the teriyaki sauce another brief stir, lift the lid on the skillet, and drizzle the sauce over the vegetables. Make sure to scrape out all the sugar from the bottom of the bowl. Using a spatula or large spoon, gently fold the rice and vegetables together until everything is mostly coated in the sauce. Make sure to scoop all the way to the bottom of the skillet when folding, as the sauce will sink to the bottom.
step 8:
Place the lid back on top and let the skillet rest for a final 5 minutes to let the flavor soak in (heat turned off). Sprinkle sliced green onions over top just before serving.

	unit: n/a
step 0:
Preheat the oven to 400ºF. In a small bowl whisk together the olive oil, red wine vinegar, mustard, crushed garlic, salt, and freshly cracked pepper for the vinaigrette. Set the vinaigrette aside.
step 1:
Slice the kielbasa into 1/4-inch thick rounds. Wash the potatoes well and slice them into 1/4-inch rounds as well. Place the kielbasa and potatoes on a large baking sheet and drizzle with 1 Tbsp olive oil. Toss the kielbasa and potatoes in the oil until they are well coated and the surface of the baking sheet is also covered in oil. Sprinkle a pinch of salt and pepper over top.
step 2:
Remove any dirty or damaged leaves from the cabbage. Cut the stem off the cabbage, then cut it in half. Reserve one half for a different recipe. Slice the remaining half into 1-inch wide slices. Cut each slice into two pieces. Place the cabbage pieces on the baking sheet with the kielbasa and potatoes, nestling them down so that they are laying flat on the baking sheet.
step 3:
Brush the remaining 1 Tbsp olive oil over the surface of the cabbage pieces and add a final pinch of salt and pepper to each.
step 4:
Roast the kielbasa, potatoes, and cabbage in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and carefully flip the kielbasa, potatoes, and cabbage pieces. The cabbage may fall apart a bit as it's flipped, which is okay. Return the baking sheet to the oven and roast for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cabbage is tender and the edges are slightly brown and crispy. The kielbasa and potato slices should be well browned.
step 5:
Remove the baking sheet from the oven and top with fresh chopped parsley and a drizzle of the mustard vinaigrette. Serve warm.

step 2:
Slice the tempeh into 1/4-inch thick slices. Heat 1 Tbsp cooking oil in a large skillet over medium. Once the skillet and oil are hot, swirl to coat the surface of the skillet in oil, then add the tempeh slices. Fry the slices until golden brown on the bottom, then flip and cook on the second side. Add an additional tablespoon of oil for the second side, if needed (tempeh tends to absorb the oil).
step 3:
Place the fried tempeh slices in a bowl. Reheat the buffalo sauce and stir until smooth (microwave 15 seconds), then pour it over the tempeh. Stir the tempeh until it is coated in buffalo sauce.
step 4:
To build the sandwiches, lay down a thick layer of the ranch slaw on a roll, then top with the buffalo tempah and sliced avocado. Enjoy!

	amount: 1/2
	unit: tsp
step 0:
Cook the bulgur according to the package directions, then spread it out onto a baking sheet or dish and transfer to the refrigerator to cool. The grain should be barely warm, at most, when assembling the salad.
step 1:
While the bulgur is cooking, make the dressing so the flavors have time to blend. Mince a clove of garlic and combine it in a bowl with the olive oil, vegetable oil, vinegar, Dijon, sugar, basil, salt, and some freshly cracked pepper. Whisk the mixture until combined. Set the dressing aside.
step 2:
Rinse the parsley well with cool water and shake off as much water as possible. Use a salad spinner or pat with a paper towel to remove excess moisture. Roughly chop the leaves, leaving the bottom of the stems behind. Place the chopped parsley in a large bowl.
step 3:
Roughly chop the dried apricots into small pieces. Add the chopped apricots and sliced almonds to the bowl with the parsley. Finally, add the cooked and cooled bulgur. Pour half of the dressing over top of the salad ingredients and toss until everything is well mixed and coated with dressing. Add more dressing if desired (I used about 3/4 of the total dressing recipe).

step 0:
Combine the dry macaroni and 2 cups of milk in a medium pot. Place a lid on top and bring it up to a boil over medium/high heat while occasionally stirring.
step 1:
As soon as it reaches a boil, reduce the heat to low and let simmer, stirring often, until the pasta is tender (about 10 minutes). Make sure to stir often during this process to keep the pasta from clumping or sticking to the bottom of the pot. Promptly replace the lid each time you finish stirring to help hold in the steam.
step 2:
Once the pasta is soft and has absorbed most of the milk, season with salt, pepper, paprika, and dijon, or the spices of your choice. If the mixture begins to look dry, add the remaining 1/4 cup of milk.
step 3:
Turn the heat off and stir in the shredded cheese until melted and creamy. Serve immediately.

	unit: lb
	name: potatoes 
	amount: 0.75
	unit: lb
step 0:
Place the stew meat in a bowl and season lightly with salt and pepper. Add the flour and stir to coat.
step 1:
Place the butter in the Instant Pot and turn on the sauté function. Heat the butter until it is melted and sizzling, then add the stew meat. Brown the meat on all sides. Don't stir too often as this will prevent the meat from achieving a nice brown, crispy exterior. The flour may coat the bottom of the pot and that is okay, just don't let it burn.
step 2:
Pour the beef broth into the pot and stir to dissolve the browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Once dissolved, add the Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, brown sugar, minced garlic, tomato paste, rosemary, and thyme.
step 3:
Wash and quarter the mushrooms. Peel and slice the carrots into one-inch sections. Wash the potatoes well, peel if desired, then chop into one-inch cubes. Add the pearl onions (no need to thaw), mushrooms, carrots, and potatoes to the Instant Pot. Give all the ingredients in the pot a good stir.
step 4:
Close the lid on the Instant Pot and close the steam valve. Press the "meat/stew" button, or set the cooker to 35 minutes of high pressure. After 35 minutes of high pressure, allow the cooker to naturally cool and release pressure.
step 5:
Once the pressure has released, open the steam valve then carefully open the lid. Give the stew a good stir, taste, and adjust the salt if needed. Serve hot with crusty bread.

	name: plain yogurt 
	amount: 1/3
	unit: cup
	name: large egg 
	amount: 1
	unit: n/a
step 0:
In a small bowl, combine the yeast, sugar and water. Stir to dissolve then let sit for a few minutes or until it is frothy on top. Once frothy, whisk in the oil, yogurt, and egg until evenly combined.
step 1:
In a separate medium bowl, combine 1 cup of the flour with the salt. Next, pour the bowl of wet ingredients to the flour/salt mixture and stir until well combined. Continue adding flour, a half cup at a time, until you can no longer stir it with a spoon (about 1 to 1.5 cups later).
step 2:
At that point, turn the ball of dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead the ball of dough for about 3 minutes, adding small amounts of flour as necessary to keep the dough from sticking. You'll end up using between 2.5 to 3 cups flour total. The dough should be smooth and very soft but not sticky. Avoid adding excessive amounts of flour as you knead, as this can make the dough too dry and stiff.
step 3:
Loosely cover the dough and let it rise until double in size (about 1 hour). After it rises, gently flatten the dough into a disc and cut it into 8 equal pieces. Shape each piece into a small ball.
step 4:
Heat a large, heavy bottomed skillet over medium heat. Working with one ball at a time, roll it out until it is about 1/4 inch thick or approximately 6 inches in diameter. Place the rolled out dough onto the hot skillet and cook until the bottom is golden brown and large bubbles have formed on the surface (see photos below). Flip the dough and cook the other side until golden brown as well. Stack the cooked flat bread on a plate and cover with a towel to keep warm as you cook the remaining pieces. Serve plain or brushed with melted butter and sprinkled with herbs!

step 0:
Place the ground turkey, green chiles (drained), sliced green onions, shredded pepper jack, cumin, garlic powder, and salt in a large bowl. Mix the ingredients until well combined. Divide and shape the mixture into five patties. The mixture will be fairly wet.
step 1:
Cook the burgers in a skillet, on a grill, or using an indoor grill like a George Foreman, until they are cooked through (internal temperature of 165ºF) and well browned on the outside. Cooking time will depend on the method, size, and thickness of your patties. 
step 2:
Serve each patty on a bun with a slice of tomato, a couple slices of avocado, and a smear of mayonnaise.

step 0:
In a small bowl, stir together the olive oil, soy sauce, apple cider vinegar, brown sugar, oregano, garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika, and a little freshly cracked pepper (about 10 cranks of a pepper mill).
step 1:
Remove the stems from the portobello mushrooms.* Place the mushrooms in a shallow dish, gill sides up. Pour some of the marinade into the gills, then flip the mushrooms and pour the rest over the top. Let the mushrooms marinate for 30 minutes, flipping occasionally.
step 2:
Heat a grill or grill pan over medium to medium-high heat. Once hot, add the marinated portobello mushrooms and cook for about 7 minutes on each side, or until the mushrooms are soft and have released most of their liquid.
step 3:
Build your marinated portobello mushroom burgers on a bun with your preferred toppings. I love the classic mix of mayonnaise, sliced tomato, onion rings, and lettuce or spring mix.

	amount: 1
	unit: Tbsp
	name: popcorn kernels
	amount: 2
	unit: Tbsp
step 0:
Add the oil and one kernel to a small sauce pot. Place the lid on top and turn the heat onto medium-high. Wait for the kernel to pop.
step 1:
Once the kernel has popped, add the rest of the kernels, replace the lid, and give the pot a swirl to coat the kernels in the hot oil. Wait for the kernels to begin to pop. You can swirl again to redistribute the hot oil, if needed.
step 2:
Once the kernels begin to pop rapidly, crack the lid a little bit to allow excess steam to escape. Make sure it's only open a little to keep the pot hot enough to continue popping the corn.
step 3:
When the popping slows to a few seconds between pops, turn off the heat. Wait a few extra seconds for the last few pops, then remove the lid and season the popcorn. Enjoy!

step 0:
Divide dry ingredients between four containers (zip-top bags, reusable plastic containers, or glass containers with lids). About 1/3 cup oats, 1 Tbsp flaxseed, 1 Tbsp hemp seeds, 1/2 Tbsp chia seeds, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, and a pinch of salt for each. If you are using a dry sweetener, like sugar, brown sugar, or stevia, you can add them to the dry mix. Store in a cool dry place indefinitely.
step 1:
To prepare the oats hot, add 2/3 cup water, milk, or non-dairy milk and stir to combine. Microwave on high for one minute, stir, then microwave in 30 second intervals until thickened. Let the seeded oats sit at room temperature for about 2 minutes to thicken further. Add in any extra items (fresh fruit, peanut butter, syrup, etc.) just before serving.
step 2:
To prepare cold oats, add 2/3 cup water, milk, or non-dairy milk, stir to combine, then refrigerate for 8 hours or up to 3-4 days. Stir in any fresh add-ins just before serving.

	name: instant yeast (or bread machine yeast)
	amount: 1/8
	unit: tsp
	name: room temperature water
	amount: 1/2
	unit: cup
step 0:
Place the oats, chia seeds, hemp hearts, and flaxseed in a small bowl. Add 1/2 cup warm water and stir to combine. Let the seeds soak for 1 hour.
step 1:
In a separate large bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, salt, and yeast. Stir until very well combined. Add the soaked seeds and then stir until they are as combined as possible (the mixture will be fairly dry). Add about 1/2 cup water, or just enough to form a sticky dough. The dough should be wet enough that there is no dry flour left on the bottom of the bowl, but not so wet that it appears slimy. It should be sticky to the touch. 
step 2:
Cover the bowl of dough loosely with plastic and let it sit at room temperature for 12-18 hours. If you can not tend to the dough within 18 hours, you can press "pause" on the fermentation by transferring the bowl to the refrigerator.
step 3:
When you're ready to make the bread, the dough should have expanded and have an almost fluffy appearance. Sprinkle it liberally with flour and scrape it away from the edges of the bowl. Turn the dough over on itself in the bowl a few times, adding more flour as needed to keep it from sticking to your hands, until it forms a smooth ball and is no longer quite as sticky.
step 4:
Transfer the ball of dough to a piece of parchment paper and let it rise for one hour. About half way through the rise time, place a Dutch oven, with its lid, into your oven and set it to bake at 425ºF. Allow the Dutch oven to preheat inside the oven for 30 minutes.
step 5:
Once the dough has risen a bit on the parchment (it will tend to spread out and not so much up), it's time to bake. Carefully remove the Dutch oven from the oven, remove the lid, and then lift up the entire piece of parchment with the dough and place them inside the Dutch oven. Place the lid back on the Dutch oven and carefully return it to the hot oven.
step 6:
Bake the bread in the Dutch oven for 30 minutes, then carefully remove the lid and bake for another 10 minutes so the top can brown. When finished baking, carefully pick up the parchment to lift the bread out of the Dutch oven and allow the bread to cool slightly before cutting and serving.

	amount: 2
	unit: Tbsp
	name: cinnamon
	amount: 1/2
	unit: tsp
step 0:
Preheat the oven to 400ºF. Wash the sweet potatoes, then carefully slice them in half lengthwise. Place the halved sweet potatoes on a baking sheet, cut side up, and drizzle the olive oil over the cut open surfaces. Use your hands to rub the oil over the entire cut surface of the sweet potatoes. Flip the sweet potatoes over, so the cut side is facing down.
step 1:
Roast the sweet potatoes, cut side down, for 30 minutes, or until they are softened and slightly caramelized on the bottom.
step 2:
While the sweet potatoes are roasting, prepare the streusel topping. Add the flour, oats, sugar, walnuts, butter, and cinnamon to a bowl. Use your hands or a pastry cutter to mix the ingredients together until it forms a crumbly mixture with pea-sized pieces. Refrigerate the streusel until it's ready to be used.
step 3:
After roasting the sweet potatoes, remove them from the oven, but leave the oven on. Use a spatula to carefully flip the sweet potatoes over so the cut sides are facing up. Use a small sharp knife to carefully score crosshatched lines into the sweet potatoes.
step 4:
Drizzle about 1 tsp maple syrup over the scored surface of each sweet potato. Pile the prepared streusel over top of each potato, then bake for another 10 minutes in the hot oven, or until the streusel is crispy. Serve hot.

step 0:
Prepare the oat crumble topping first, so it's ready to go on the muffins as soon as they're mixed. In a small bowl, combine the oats, butter, brown sugar, and cinnamon. Use your hands to massage the oats, brown sugar, and cinnamon, into the butter until it's evenly combined and clumpy. Refrigerate the mixture until you're ready to top the muffins.
step 1:
Preheat the oven to 500 degrees. In a large bowl, combine the all-purpose and whole wheat flours, oats, brown sugar, white sugar, salt, baking powder, and cinnamon. Stir well.
step 2:
In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, eggs, and oil.
step 3:
Pour the whisked wet ingredients into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Stir just until they are combined, it doesn't need to be perfectly mixed. There may still be clumps and a few dry spots, but it's important to avoid over mixing.
step 4:
Add the frozen berries to the mixture and gently fold in. Again, avoid over mixing because the berry juice will turn the muffins blueish grey.
step 5:
Line eight muffin tin cups with paper liners, then fill each one to the top with the muffin batter (use more cups if needed, just make sure to fill to the top). Sprinkle the prepared oat crumble topping onto each muffin.
step 6:
Transfer the muffin tin to the oven and immediately turn the heat down to 400 degrees. Bake for 22-25 minutes, or until the muffins have risen into peaks, have cracked slightly, and are deep golden brown on top. Remove the muffins from the oven and the muffin tin (use a knife to loosen any parts that have spilled out over top) and allow them to cool.

step 0:
Add 1/4 cup rolled oats to the bottom of four 12oz. mason jars, or another container of comparable size. Add 1/3 cup of yogurt on top of the oats in each jar.
step 1:
Slice the bananas, drain the pineapple (the juice can be saved for smoothies), and dice the mango. Divide the sliced bananas, pineapple chunks, and mango between the four jars. Layering the bananas between the yogurt and pineapple will help prevent the banana from browning. Top each jar off with a tablespoon of shredded coconut.
step 2:
Refrigerate the jars overnight to allow the oats time to soak and soften. Use a spoon to stir the ingredients in the jar just before eating. Refrigerate the parfaits for up to five days.

	name: unsweetened shredded coconut* 
	amount: 1
	unit: cup
	name: banana chips* 
	amount: 1
	unit: cup
step 0:
Preheat the oven to 300 degrees. Mash the bananas with a fork until they're mostly smooth (a few chunks are okay). Measure the banana mash, then add enough unsweetened apple sauce to make 2 cups total (about one cup of each).
step 1:
Place the bananas and apple sauce in a small sauce pan with the peanut butter, cinnamon, vanilla extract, and salt. Stir and cook over low heat for about five minutes, or until the mixture is evenly mixed and warmed through (this makes it more runny and easier to mix with the oats).
step 2:
Add the dry oats and shredded coconut to a very large bowl. Pour the banana, apple sauce, and peanut butter mixture over the oats and coconut, then stir well until all of the ingredients are incorporated. There should be no clumps of dry oats left.
step 3:
Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper, then spread the oat mixture in an even layer over the parchment, no more than one inch thick. If there is too much for one baking sheet, divide the mixture between two sheets.
step 4:
Bake the granola in the 300 degree oven for one to one and a half hours, stirring once after 30 minutes, then every 15 minutes after that**. Baking time will vary depending on whether you use one or two baking sheets. Keep an eye on the granola and stir every 15 minutes towards the end. The granola is finished when it is crisp and golden brown. Allow the granola to cool completely. Crush the banana chips into small pieces, then stir into the granola. Store the cooled granola in an air-tight container.

Sprinkle the dried cranberries and almonds over top. Push the toppings down into the oats slightly, so that when the oats freeze they will hold onto the toppings.
step 2:
Place the muffin tin in the refrigerator until completely cooled, then transfer to the freezer until completely frozen. Once the oats are completely frozen, transfer them to an air-tight freezer bag.
step 3:
To serve, place 2-3 pucks of oatmeal into a microwave safe bowl and heat on high until warm (stir occasionally). You can add a splash of milk to keep it moist as it reheats.

step 3:
Add the soy milk and beat briefly again until smooth. Always start on low speed to prevent splashing. Add the rest of the flour and oat mixture, and beat until combined (only about 30 seconds).
step 4:
Add the chopped walnuts and coconut. Stir them into the batter. Pour the batter into a 9x9 inch greased casserole dish. Bake for 30 minutes. Allow the bars to cool and then cut into 9 pieces. Store in an air-tight container in the refrigerator for 5-6 days, or freeze for extended storage.

step 0:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Stir the lemon juice into the milk and let sit until ready to use.
step 1:
In a large bowl, combine both flours, the oats, sugar, salt, baking powder, baking soda, rosemary (crushed or chopped), and black pepper. Stir until combined.
step 2:
Place the butter in a small pot and melt over medium heat. Swirl and cook over medium heat until the butter turns golden brown and smells sweet and nutty. Turn off the heat.
step 3:
Pour the prepared milk and the browned butter into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Stir until it is thoroughly combined and no dry flour remains on the bottom of the bowl. The dough will be wet and sticky. Turn it out onto a well floured surface and knead only a few times (5-10 turns) until it is a cohesive ball. Do not over knead.
step 4:
Divide the dough into two pieces and shape each into a ball. Place the balls on a baking sheet covered with foil or parchment. Brush a lightly beaten egg white over the top of each and sprinkle with more black pepper (optional). Cut an “X” into the top of each with a sharp knife, place in the oven, and bake for 45 minutes. Allow to cool before breaking the bread open.

	unit: tsp
	name: raisins 
	amount: 1/2
	unit: cup
step 0:
Begin by preheating the oven to 325 degrees. In a large bowl combine the rolled oats, ground flaxseed, and pecans (roughly chopped). Stir until combined.
step 1:
In a small saucepan, combine the honey, brown sugar, oil, salt, and cinnamon. Cook over low heat while stirring until the brown sugar is dissolved. Turn off the heat and stir in the vanilla.
step 2:
Pour the honey mixture over the dry oat mixture. Stir well until all of the oats are coated (this may take a couple minutes of stirring). Pour the mixture out onto a baking sheet covered in parchment paper. Spread it out into an even layer.
step 3:
Bake the granola in the oven for 30 minutes, stirring half way through. Keep an eye on the granola as every oven is different. If it begins to smell burned, remove from the oven immediately. You want the granola to toast, but not burn.
step 4:
Remove the granola from the oven and stir in the raisins. Press the granola down to compress it on the baking sheet. This will help it form clumps as it cools. The granola will feel soft when it is hot, but will crisp up and become crunchy as it cools. After it cools, store in an air-tight container.

step 0:
Wash the peaches and cut them into small pieces. In a small bowl combine the honey, sriracha, and cinnamon. Pour over the peaches and toss to coat. Sprinkle the cornstarch over the peaches and toss to coat again.
step 1:
In a separate bowl, combine the oats, flour, salt, and brown sugar. Stir until evenly mixed. Add the butter and mix it in until it forms a crumbly, sand-like mixture. I find it best to just get my hands in there and “squish” it all together.
step 2:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Place the seasoned peaches in the bottom of an 8×8 (or round) baking dish. Cover the peaches completely with the oat mixture. Bake in the preheated oven for about 30 minutes or until golden brown on top and the fruit is bubbling up. Serve hot or cold!

	amount: n/a
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Place the oats and butter in a large bowl and pour two cups of boiling water over top. Let rest for 1 hour to allow the oats to soften.
step 1:
In a small bowl, soak the yeast in 1/2 cup of warm water for 5 minutes. Add the molasses, salt, and dissolved yeast to the bowl of soaked oats. Stir to combine.
step 2:
Stir in two cups of whole wheat flour. Begin adding the all-purpose flour, 1/2 cup at a time, until you can no longer stir it with a spoon.
step 3:
Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and continue to knead in all-purpose flour until you have a soft, pliable, not sticky ball of dough. You want to knead for at least 5 minutes to properly develop the gluten and you should have added 5-6 cups of flour total (whole wheat and all-purpose). The dough may be slightly tacky due to the sticky molasses, but it should not be super sticky.
step 4:
Place the ball of dough in an oiled bowl, loosely cover, and let rise until double (1.5 hours). Punch the dough down, divide into two, and shape into loaves. Place the loaves in oiled bread pans, loosely cover and let rise until they are about 1-2 inches above the rim of the pan (another 1.5 hours).
step 5:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Bake the risen loaves for 35-40 minutes or until deep brown on the surface. Turn the loaves out of the bread pans and onto a wire cooling rack. Let the loaves cool completely before slicing!

step 0:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Clean the peaches and cut them into chunks. Place the peaches and blueberries in the bottom of an 8×8 baking dish coated with non-stick spray.
step 1:
In one bowl, whisk together the wet ingredients (milk, yogurt, egg, sugar). In a separate bowl, stir together the dry ingredients (oats, baking powder, baking soda, salt, ginger, cinnamon). Combine the two bowls and stir until evenly mixed. Pour the mixture over the fruit in the baking dish.
step 2:
Cover the dish with foil (to keep the moisture in and steam the oats) and place in the preheated oven. Cook for 20 minutes. Remove the foil at 20 minutes and continue to bake until the top is golden brown (about 25 minutes more).
step 3:
Serve warm with cold milk, whipped cream, vanilla yogurt or just plain!

step 0:
Wash the peaches, remove the pit and dice into one inch pieces. Place the peach chunks in the bottom of a glass casserole dish (8×8 inch works well, a glass pie dish will also work).
step 1:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Sprinkle the lemon juice, corn starch, almond extract and sliced almonds over the peach chunks. Stir the mixture until the peaches are well coated.
step 2:
In a separate bowl, combine the flour, oats, brown sugar, cinnamon and salt. Stir until they are well mixed and no chunks of brown sugar remain.
step 3:
Mix the room temperature butter into the mixed dry ingredients until it is evenly incorporated. Your hands will work best for this job. I simply “squish” the butter into the dry ingredients over and over and over until it is all mixed.
step 4:
Pour the buttery crumble topping over the peach mixture and bake it in the preheated oven (375 degrees) for 45 minutes. Let cool slightly before serving!

	amount: 1
	unit: cup
step 0:
Preheat your oven to 350 degrees. Spray a small glass baking dish (8×8 or 8×11) with non-stick spray.
step 1:
In a large bowl, combine the flour, brown sugar, oats, salt and baking soda. Mix well until all of the ingredients are combined and no sugar clumps remain. Using your hands, “smoosh” the room temperature butter into the dry mixture. Mix it very well until it is of even consistency. It should resemble a sandy/crubmbly mixture (see photos below).
step 2:
Evenly sprinkle half of the crumb mixture into the bottom of your glass pan. Press it down to make it compact. Carefully distribute the jam over the pressed crumb mixture. Drop the jam down in small bits because if you try to spread it, it will pull the crumb topping up off of the bottom of the dish. Keep the jam about 1/2 inch away from the edges so that it does not burn on the glass while baking. Sprinkle on the remaining half of the crumb mixture. Pat down lightly but do not completely pack it in like the bottom layer.
step 3:
Bake the jam bars for 35 minutes or until it is golden brown on top. Let cool for 10 minutes then cut into 12 or 15 squares.

Add the carrots, green onion, sunflower seeds, and dried cranberries to the bowl with the cabbage and broccoli. Stir until everything is evenly combined. This mixture can be refrigerated for 4-5 days, undressed.
step 2:

step 0:
Prepare the dressing first to allow the flavors time to blend. Place the neutral oil, vinegar, soy sauce, toasted sesame oil, brown sugar, ginger, and sesame seeds in a jar or other small container with a lid, and shake until combined. Set the dressing aside.
step 1:
Shred the cabbage as finely as possible. Use a large-holed cheese grater, mandolin, or food processor to shred the carrot. Finely dice the bell pepper, and slice the green onion. Cook the edamame according to the package directions (mine required microwaving for 5 minutes). 
step 2:
Place all the vegetables in a large bowl and pour about half the dressing over top. Toss the ingredients together until everything is combined and coated in dressing. Taste and add more dressing if desired (I used about 3/4 of the dressing). Serve immediately or refrigerate until you're ready to eat. Always stir the slaw just before serving to redistribute the dressing.

	amount: 4
	unit: n/a
	name: cooked rice
	amount: 4
	unit: cups
step 0:
Prepare the slaw first so that the salt and lemon juice have time to soften the cabbage. Slice or shred the cabbage as thinly as possible (this is very important). Use a large-holed cheese grater to shred the carrot. Roughly chop a handful of cilantro leaves.
step 1:
Combine the cabbage, carrot, cilantro, lemon juice, oil, and salt in a bowl. Stir to combine. Let the cabbage sit for at least 30 minutes to soften, stirring occasionally.
step 2:
Combine all the ingredients for the chimichurri in a food processor or blender and pulse until the herbs are finely chopped. Alternately, you can mince the garlic, parsley, and cilantro with a knife and then stir them together with the remaining ingredients.
step 3:
Begin preheating the oven to 400ºF. Place the cod steaks in a baking dish. Spoon half of the chimichurri over top, reserving the other half for drizzling over the bowls after baking. Bake the fish for 12-15 minutes, or until it is cooked through (the fish should flake when a fork is inserted, but still be moist).
step 4:
To build the bowls, place one cup cooked rice in a bowl, top with a heaping cup of the slaw (make sure to stir just before serving), and then place the baked fish on top. Drizzle some of the remaining chimichurri over the entire bowl and enjoy!

step 0:
If using wooden skewers, place them in a shallow dish and add an inch or two of water. Soak the skewers as you prepare the ingredients. This prevents them from burning and catching fire from the close, intense heat of the grill or broiler.
step 1:
First prepare the chimichurri. Pull the parsley and cilantro leaves from their stems, then chop them finely. Mince the garlic.
step 2:
Combine the chopped parsley, cilantro, garlic, olive oil, red wine vinegar, oregano, cumin, crushed red pepper, and salt in a bowl. Stir to combine.
step 3:
Cut the chicken breast into 1-inch cubes. Count your chicken pieces so you'll know roughly how many you want to use per skewer later. Place the cubed chicken in a bowl and add two spoonfuls of the prepared chimichurri, saving the remaining chimichurri to drizzle on after cooking. Stir to coat the chicken in the chimichurri.
step 4:
Dice the bell pepper, zucchini, mushrooms, and red onion into 1-1.5 inch pieces. Place the vegetables in a large bowl and add 2 Tbsp olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper. Toss the vegetables until they are well coated in oil.
step 5:
Adjust your oven's rack so that the top of a baking sheet or broiler pan will be about 5 inches from the oven's broiler. Turn the broiler on to begin pre-heating. 
step 6:
Place two wire racks on a baking sheet, or use a broiler pan. Begin building your kebabs by adding chicken and vegetable pieces in random order. I had about 24 chicken pieces, so I used three pieces of chicken per skewer, adding random vegetables between.
step 7:
Place your kebabs on the prepared baking sheet or broiler pan. Once all the skewers are filled, place the pan under the broiler. Broil until the tops of the vegetables just begin to brown (about 8-10 minutes). Watch the kebabs closely, as broilers can cook food VERY QUICKLY. Remove the pan from the oven, carefully flip the kebabs and place back under the broiler. Broil until the second side begins to brown (about 4-5 minutes). 
step 8:
Serve the chimichurri chicken kebabs over a bed of rice with a spoonful or two of the remaining chimichurr drizzled over top.

The moisture from the filet will help the spices adhere. If the fish is very wet, pat it dry with a paper towel before beginning, so that it is just damp.
step 1:
Melt 1 Tbsp of butter in a skillet over medium heat until it begins to foam. Add two of the fish filets at a time and cook for about two minutes on each side, or until the spices have turned a deep burgundy color and the fish is cooked through. Repeat with the second two filets, adding more butter before beginning, if needed. Serve hot.

	name: vegetable oil 
	amount: 6
	unit: Tbsp
	name: to taste salt and pepper 
	amount: n/a
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Trim the chicken breasts of any large clumps of fat that may be still attached. Slice each breast in half diagonally to create two diamond-like shaped pieces. Using a small, sharp knife, cut a pocket into the side of each breast piece. This can be slightly tricky on thinner pieces so be careful. Be sure not to cut all the way through the meat but rather just into one side so that the fillings will stay in. See photos below.
step 1:
Stuff each piece of chicken with 1/2 oz. of cheese and about 4 slices of pepperoni. Lightly season each piece with salt and pepper. Set the stuffed chicken aside.
step 2:
Preheat your oven to 350 degrees and line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Begin to heat a large skillet with 6 Tbsp of vegetable oil over medium/high heat. Collect three shallow dishes and put the flour in one, the egg in another and the bread crumbs in the third. Beat the egg until it is an even consistency (adding a 1/2 tsp of water helps break it up).
step 3:
One by one, coat each piece of chicken in the flour, then the egg then the bread crumbs. Use your hands so that you can keep the open side of the pocket pinched closed and keep the fillings in. The flour helps the egg adhere and the egg keeps the bread crumbs in place. This is a basic bread coating.
step 4:
Test the oil in the skillet to see if it is hot enough by dropping a small pinch of bread crumbs in. The bread crumbs should sizzle and dance A LOT. It is very important that the oil is hot enough or else the breading will soak up a lot of oil and you’ll end up with some really greasy chicken!. Place all four pieces of chicken in the skillet and cook until it is golden brown and crispy on each side. This should take no more than 2-3 minutes.
step 5:
When you remove the chicken pieces from the skillet, transfer them to the baking sheet and place it in the oven. Finish baking the chicken (to cook the inside) for about 25 minutes (longer if you have larger pieces). Remove from the oven (check to make sure the chicken is cooked through) and serve immediately!

	name: large eggs, beaten
	amount: 2
	unit: n/a
	name: all purpose flour 
	amount: 1/2
	unit: cup
step 0:
Finely dice the onion and garlic. Cook them in a small skillet using 2 Tbsp of olive oil until they are soft and translucent.
step 1:
In a large bowl combine the ground beef, Italian sausage (remove from the casing), bread crumbs, parmesan cheese, beaten eggs, parsley and onion/garlic mixture (let cool slightly so they can be handled with your bare hands). Using your hands, mix and squish it all together until it is thoroughly combined. Your hands really are the only tool that will accomplish this effectively so if you don’t like touching raw meat, you better get yourself some gloves!
step 2:
Prepare your meatball making station by getting a small bowl and putting a 1/2 cup of flour in it. You will be dredging the meatballs in the flour before pan frying them. Also grab a large plate or platter to hold the flour dredged meatballs prior to frying. Using your hands (again) grab small amounts of meatball mix and roll into small balls (I made mine slightly smaller than a golf ball) and then roll them around in the flour until coated lightly. Place the floured meatballs on the plate and continue until you have used all of the meatball mix. You will probably need to rinse your hands every 10 meatballs or so because they get coated and sticky, making the rolling quite difficult.
step 3:
Preheat your oven to 350 degrees and get a large glass dish ready for baking. Put the remaining 1/4 cup of olive oil in a large skillet and heat it over medium/high heat until it is very hot but not smoking (if you drop a little flour in it, it will sizzle A LOT when it’s ready). Working in batches (about 10 at a time), brown the meatballs on all sides (about 30 seconds to 1 minute on each side). The meatballs do not need to be cooked through because you will bake them as well. Basically, you are just adding texture, flavor and strength to the meatball by searing the outside.
step 4:
As you remove each batch of meatballs from the skillet, place them in the glass dish until they are all done pan frying. Place the glass dish full of meatballs in the oven and cook at 350 for about 25 minutes or until cooked through. If you made larger meatballs they will take longer to cook. If you are unsure about whether or not your meatballs are done cooking, simply sacrifice the largest one you can find and see if it is still pink inside.

step 0:
Make sure your natural style peanut butter is thoroughly mixed before measuring (you don’t want to get all oil or all solids). In a blender or food processor combine all of the ingredients except the sriracha sauce. Begin with only 1/4 cup of water and add more until you get the consistency you want (I used 1/2 cup total). Add the sriracha sauce a little at a time (blending between) until it is to your desired heat (I used about 1/2 tsp).
step 1:
Enjoy the peanut sauce on salads, pasta or as a dipping sauce!

	amount: 1/4
	unit: cup
	name: sriracha hot sauce 
	amount: 2
	unit: Tbsp.
step 0:
Make the teriyaki marinade by whisking together the soy sauce, water, sesame oil, minced garlic, grated ginger, brown sugar, rice wine, and corn starch (use a vegetable peeler to remove the ginger skin and then grate with a fine toothed cheese grater).
step 1:
Cut the salmon filet into four equal sized portions and place in a large zip top bag. Pour the marinade over top, remove as much air as possible and close up the bag. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, mixing the bag occasionally to redistribute the marinade.
step 2:
Heat a large, well oiled skillet over medium/high heat. It’s a good idea to use a non-stick surface here too just to be safe (teflon or well seasoned cast iron). The teriyaki sauce gets thick and sticky when cooked. Once the skillet is hot, add the fish, face down. Cook on all four sides for 2-3 minutes each side or until the fish has reached your desired doneness.
step 3:
In a small bowl, mix together the sriracha hot sauce and mayonnaise. Serve the fish with a dollop of sriracha mayo on top!

step 1:
Mince the clove of garlic and add it to the pot with the rice. Also add the salt, the coconut milk, and one cup of fresh water. Stir to combine the ingredients.
step 2:
Place a lid on the pot and bring it up to a rolling boil over high heat. As soon as the rice reaches a full boil, turn the heat down to the lowest setting. Allow it to simmer on the lowest setting for 30 minutes. Turn the heat off and allow it to rest, undisturbed, with the lid in place, for an additional 15 minutes.
step 3:
Remove the lid, fluff with a fork, and serve.

step 1:
Add the melted butter and milk to the dry ingredients in the mug and stir until a thick batter forms.
step 2:
In a separate small bowl or mug, melt the butter for the cinnamon butter swirl (about 15 seconds in the microwave). Stir the brown sugar and cinnamon into the melted butter. 
step 3:
Drizzle the cinnamon butter swirl over the mug cake batter, then gently fold them together until they are only about half mixed. There should be thick ribbons of the cinnamon butter swirl throughout the batter.
step 4:
Microwave the mug cake for 45-55 seconds (for a 1100 watt microwave, cooking time will vary with microwave wattage). The mug cake will create quite a bit of steam as it cooks, so don't be alarmed. Let the mug cake cool for 1-2 minutes.
step 5:
While the mug cake is cooling, stir together the powdered sugar and milk for the icing, using the same small bowl used for the cinnamon butter swirl. The residual cinnamon in the bowl will flavor the icing.
step 6:
Drizzle the icing over the mug cake and enjoy while it is still warm.

	name: brown sugar
	amount: 2 
	unit: Tbsp
step 0:
If your shrimp is frozen, thaw it first by placing in a colander and running cool water over it until thawed (this only takes a few minutes).
step 1:
Finely dice the onion and place it in the bottom of the rice cooker along with the frozen peas (I did not thaw my peas). Add the uncooked rice, minced garlic, and grated ginger. Stir these ingredients together.
step 2:
Add the shrimp to the top of the rice mixture, then pour in 2 cups water. Close the lid and set the cooker to the "white rice" setting. The rice cooker will begin to heat and once the contents inside reach the appropriate temperature, it will begin to count down the cooking time (12 minutes for my model).
step 3:
Once the rice cooker finishes its cooking cycle, let it rest for an additional 5-10 minutes on the keep warm cycle before opening the lid. While waiting, stir together the soy sauce and brown sugar.
step 4:
Finally, open the lid and pour the soy sauce mixture over the contents in the rice cooker. Use a rice paddle to gently fold the sauce into the rice. Serve hot, with sriracha or sliced green onions if desired.

step 0:
Preheat the oven to 425ºF. Place a wire cooling rack over a baking sheet to hold the breaded chicken.
step 1:
In a wide shallow bowl or container, combine the bread crumbs, garlic powder, smoked paprika, cayenne, salt, and some freshly cracked pepper for the chicken's breading. Once combined, add the cooking oil and stir until the seasoned breadcrumbs resemble damp sand.
step 2:
In a separate wide shallow bowl or container, combine the yogurt, salt, and hot sauce.
step 3:
Place the chicken breast on a cutting board, cover with plastic, then use a mallet or rolling pin to gently pound the chicken breast to an even thickness, no more than 3/4-inch thick. Cut the chicken breast in half, then season with a pinch of salt and a pinch of cayenne.
step 4:
Dip each piece of chicken into the yogurt and hot sauce mixture, making sure to fully coat the chicken, then into the seasoned bread crumbs, again coating both sides. Place the coated chicken on the prepared baking sheet with wire rack.
step 5:
Bake the chicken for 25 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 165ºF, carefully flipping the chicken once half way through. 
step 6:
While the chicken is baking, prepare the honey yogurt slaw. In a small bowl stir together the mayonnaise, yogurt, honey, Dijon, vinegar, salt, and some freshly cracked pepper. 
step 7:
Place the shredded cabbage slaw mix in a large bowl, pour the prepared dressing over top, and stir until the cabbage is coated in dressing.
step 8:
Once the chicken is finished baking, build the sandwiches. Place one piece of spicy chicken on each bun and top with a generous pile of the honey yogurt slaw. Enjoy!

	amount: 1
	unit: 20 oz. can
	name: soy sauce
	amount: 1/4
	unit: cup
	name: brown sugar

	name: green onions, sliced
	amount: 2
	unit: n/a
	name: cooked rice, for serving (optional)
	amount: 5
	unit: cups
step 0:
Separate the juice from the pineapple chunks. You should have approximately 3/4 cup juice. The juice will go into the sauce and the pineapple chunks will be added later. Refrigerate the pineapple chunks until they're needed.
step 1:
To make the pineapple teriyaki sauce, stir together the pineapple juice, soy sauce, brown sugar, minced garlic, and grated ginger. If you have a little less than 3/4 cup pineapple juice, you can add a bit of water to bring it up to 3/4 cup. 
step 2:
Place the chicken thighs in the slow cooker and pour the pineapple teriyaki sauce over top. Close the slow cooker and cook on high for four hours or low for eight hours. Flip the chicken 3/4 of the way through cooking to make sure all the meat is exposed to the marinade.
step 3:
After cooking, carefully lift the chicken out of the slow cooker (it will be fall-apart tender). In a small bowl, stir together the cornstarch with 2 Tbsp water, then whisk it into the remaining liquid in the slow cooker. Replace the lid and let it simmer for 5 minutes on high, or until thickened.
step 4:
Once the sauce is thickened, add the pineapple chunks and stir to combine. Finally, add the cooked chicken back to the pot and coat with sauce. Sprinkle sliced green onions over top, and serve over a bed of rice.

Mince the garlic and add it to the pot along with the salt, turmeric, coconut milk, and 1.5 cups of water. Give it a gentle stir to make sure everything is mixed.
step 2:
Bring the pot up to a boil over medium-high heat (use a lid to make this faster). Once it is boiling, remove the lid and let it boil gently for about 20 minutes or until most of the liquid is absorbed. When most of the liquid is absorbed, turn off the heat and let sit for about 5 minutes to continue to absorb. Taste and season with more salt if desired.

	name: water 
	amount: 6
	unit: cups
	name: salt 
	amount: 2-3
	unit: tsp
step 0:
Spread the dry beans out onto a baking sheet to pick through them and remove any stones or bad pieces. Place the beans in a colander and rinse with cool water.
step 1:
Dice the onion. Cut the stem off the jalapeño, slice it open lengthwise, and remove the seeds and ribs by scraping with a spoon. Dice the jalapeño and mince the garlic. Place the onion, garlic, and jalapeño in the slow cooker along with the cumin, chili powder, and black pepper. Do not add the salt.
step 2:
Add the sorted and rinsed beans to the slow cooker along with 6 cups of water. Stir everything to distribute the seasoning. Secure the lid and cook on high for 4-5 hours or on low for 8. It’s okay if they cook longer, they’ll just be easier to mash.
step 3:
After cooking, remove about 1 cup of the water and reserve it in a bowl. Mash the beans and add the reserved water back in as needed. Make the beans a little thinner in texture than you’d expect because they will thicken as they cool. Season the mashed beans with salt, beginning with one teaspoon and adding more to taste. I used approximately 1 Tbsp but add a little at a time until you’re satisfied. Serve warm!

Taste and season with salt as needed (I added 1/2 tsp).
step 3:
Serve the ropa in a bowl, over rice, or in a warm tortilla.

	unit: n/a
	name: orzo
	amount: 1.5
	unit: cups
	name: feta, crumbled
	amount: 2
	unit: oz
step 0:
Blot the chicken thighs dry with a paper towel, then season both sides liberally with lemon pepper seasoning (about 1 tsp per chicken thigh).
step 1:
Heat a large, deep skillet over medium flame. Add 1 Tbsp canola or vegetable oil. When the oil is hot (it should be shimmering), add the chicken thighs, skin side down. Allow the thighs to cook until browned, then flip and brown on the second side (about five minutes on each side for bone-in thighs with skin). Remove the cooked thighs to a clean plate.
step 2:
While the thighs are browning, mince two cloves of garlic and roughly chop 1/4 bunch of parsley.
step 3:
After removing the chicken from the skillet, pour off the excess fat and turn the heat down to low. Add the garlic and sauté for about one minute. Add the chicken broth and stir to dissolve the browned bits from the bottom of the skillet.
step 4:
Add about half of the chopped parsley, one additional teaspoon of lemon pepper seasoning, and the orzo to the skillet. Stir to combine. Return the chicken thighs to the skillet, skin side up.
step 5:
Cover the skillet and turn the heat up to high. Allow the broth to come to a boil, then turn the heat down to low. Let the skillet simmer on low for 10-12 minutes, or until the orzo is tender. (If the broth stops simmering, increase the heat slightly to keep it simmering.)
step 6:
After 12 minutes, the orzo should be tender and most of the broth absorbed. If there is still too much liquid, allow it to simmer without the lid for a few minutes. It's okay if the orzo is slightly saucy. Sprinkle the remaining parsley over top along with the crumbled feta.

step 0:
Remove the tofu from its package and wrap it in a clean, lint-free kitchen towel or a few layers of paper towel. Place the wrapped tofu between two plates and place something heavy on top (like a pot full of water). Let the tofu press for at least 30 minutes.
step 1:
While the tofu is pressing, prepare the kale. Remove the stems from the kale, then cut the leaves into one-inch wide strips. Rinse the leaves well in a colander with cool water. Let drain.
step 2:
Mince the garlic and add it to large pot with one tablespoon cooking oil. Sauté over medium heat for about one minute. Add the washed kale and continue to stir and cook until the kale is wilted (about five minutes). Stir in the soy sauce, sesame oil, and sesame seeds. Set the kale aside.
step 3:
Prepare the sauce for the tofu. In a small bowl, stir together the chili garlic sauce, soy sauce, and brown sugar. Once the tofu is finished pressing, cut it into small cubes or rectangles.
step 4:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, add one tablespoon of cooking oil. Tilt the skillet to make sure the surface is completely covered. Add the tofu pieces. Let them fry until golden brown on bottom, then flip and fry until golden brown on the other side. Continue until the pieces are golden brown on most sides. (The tofu will stick until it is browned, at which point it will loosen from the skillet, so don't try to move or flip the tofu pieces too early.)
step 5:
Once the tofu is browned on most sides, turn off the heat, pour the prepared chili garlic sauce into the skillet, and stir to coat. The sauce will thicken slightly and absorb into the tofu.
step 6:
To build the bowls, add one cup of cooked rice to each bowl along with 1/4 of the sesame kale and 1/4 of the chili garlic tofu pieces. Slice a lime into wedges and serve each bowl with one or two wedges and a few sprigs of fresh cilantro. Squeeze fresh lime juice over the bowl just before eating.

	amount: 1/4
	unit: cup
step 0:
Chill a 2 quart or larger glass or metal casserole dish or bread pan in the freezer while you prepare the ice cream mixture.
step 1:
In a medium bowl, stir together the sweetened condensed milk, mint extract, and vanilla extract.
step 2:
In a separate large bowl, whip the heavy whipping cream until stiff peaks form (use a hand mixer or a whisk and some elbow grease). Be sure not to over whip the cream to the point where it breaks down and separates.
step 3:
Take a scoop of the whipped cream and fold it into the bowl with the sweetened condensed milk. This will help lighten the thick condensed milk a bit.
step 4:
Now take about 1/3 of the sweetened condensed milk and fold it into the bowl of whipped cream. Fold gently until it is incorporated, then add 1/3 more and gently fold the mixture again. Repeat this process until all the sweetened condensed milk is incorporated into the whipped cream and the mixture is smooth.
step 5:
Spoon the ice cream mixture into the chilled dish and spread the top smooth. Cover and chill the mixture for two hours. After chilling, drizzle the chocolate syrup over top and add the chocolate chips. Gently fold the syrup and chips into the chilled mixture to create a marbled texture (don't over stir). Return the ice cream to the freezer and freeze until solid (6-8 hours). Scoop and enjoy!

step 0:
Cut the block of tempeh into 32 thin triangles. For the block I used, I first cut it into 8 equal-sized squares, then cut each square into two triangles, then cut the thickness of each triangle in half to make the pieces thinner. Add the tempeh triangles to a large non-stick skillet.
step 1:
Make the sweet and spicy marinade by combining the water, garlic powder, smoked paprika, cayenne, salt, brown sugar, and olive oil. Pour this mixture over the tempeh in the skillet. Turn the skillet on to medium-high and simmer the tempeh, stirring occasionally, until the liquid evaporates and the tempeh begins to brown just slightly (about 10 minutes). Remove the tempeh from the heat.
step 2:
To make the polenta, combine the cornmeal, salt, and water in a medium sauce pot. Place the pot over medium-high heat and bring it up to a boil while whisking. Once it reaches a boil, turn the heat down to medium-low and continue to simmer 2-3 minutes more, or until the polenta has thickened. Remove the polenta from the heat and stir in the butter.
step 3:
To build the bowls, start with 1 cup of the polenta, add 1/4 of the sweet and spicy tempeh triangles, 1/4 of the rinsed black beans, a pinch or two of shredded cheddar (about 1/2 oz.), 1/4 of the avocado, a sprinkle of green onions, and a light drizzle of ranch. Serve immediately, or refrigerate and reheat later.

	unit: n/a
	name: jerk seasoning
	amount: 1
	unit: Tbsp
	name: cooking oil
	amount: 1
	unit: Tbsp
step 0:
Begin cooking your rice first. If you plan on packing this for meal prep, transfer the cooked rice to your meal prep containers and refrigerate them as you finish the rest of the recipe, so they can begin to cool down.
step 1:
While the rice is cooking, prepare the pineapple black bean salsa. Coarsely chop the pineapple tidbits into smaller pieces, similar in size to the black beans. Place the chopped pineapple, rinsed black beans, diced red onion, and chopped cilantro in a large bowl.
step 2:
Squeeze the juice of half the lime (about 1 Tbsp) over the ingredients in the bowl. Also add 1/4 tsp salt and a pinch of red pepper flakes (optional). Stir the ingredients together, give it a taste, and add more salt or lime juice if needed. Any unused lime will be cut into wedges for squeezing over the chicken before serving.
step 3:
Next, prepare the jerk chicken. Pat the chicken breasts dry with a paper towel. Place a piece of plastic wrap over the chicken to eliminate splatter, then gently pound the chicken breasts into an even thickness using either a rolling pin or a mallet. Sprinkle the jerk seasoning over both sides of the chicken and use your hands to rub it into the surface, making sure they're completely coated.
step 4:
Add the cooking oil to a large skillet, or preheat your grill. Once hot, add the chicken and cook until well browned on both sides, and the chicken is completely cooked through (about 7 minutes each side). It should no longer be pink in the center and the juices should run clear. For extra safety, use an instant read meat thermometer and cook until the internal temperature reaches 165ºF.
step 5:
Transfer the cooked chicken to a clean cutting board and let it rest for five minutes. After five minutes, slice the chicken into 1/2-wide strips.
step 6:
To serve, place about a cup of cooked rice on a plate, or in your meal prep container, top with about a cup of the pineapple black bean salsa, and a few strips of the jerk chicken. Slice the remaining lime into wedges and squeeze fresh juice over the chicken just before eating.

	amount: 1/2
	unit: cup
	name: salt & pepper to taste
	amount: n/a
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Bring a large pot of water to a boil for the pasta. Once boiling, add the pasta and continue to boil until the pasta is tender. Reserve about one cup of the starchy pasta water, then drain the pasta in a colander.
step 1:
While the pasta is cooking, prepare the rest of the recipe. Slice the grape tomatoes in half and slice or roughly chop the basil. Mince the garlic.
step 2:
Add the olive oil to a large skillet and place it over medium heat. Once hot, add the garlic and sauté for just one minute to take the raw edge off the garlic.
step 3:
Add the grape tomatoes and a pinch of salt to the skillet. Stir to combine, then place a lid on the skillet and let the tomato simmer for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Let the tomatoes simmer just until they begin to break down and they have released their juices. The tomatoes should just be beginning to lose their shape and their skins should appear a bit wrinkled.
step 4:
Turn the heat off and add the butter, most of the basil (save some to garnish with), and some freshly cracked pepper. Stir until the butter is melted, then taste and adjust the salt and pepper as needed. You want it to be slightly on the salty side, as the saltiness will dilute a bit once it's combined with the pasta.
step 5:
Add the cooked and drained pasta and stir to coat the pasta in the tomato sauce. Add a splash or two of the reserved pasta water if the mixture appears dry.
step 6:
Top the pasta with dollops of ricotta, a little more pepper, and any reserved basil, then serve!

	amount: 1.5
	unit: cups
step 0:
Place the spinach in a bowl and allow it to thaw slightly as you prepare the beginning of the dish. Dice the onion and mince the garlic.
step 1:
Add the olive oil to a heavy bottomed pot or deep skillet along with the minced garlic, oregano, basil, thyme, rosemary, a pinch of crushed red pepper, and a little freshly cracked black pepper (about 10 cranks of a pepper mill). Sauté the spices over medium-low heat for about one minute.
step 2:
Add the tomato paste and brown sugar to the pot and continue to sauté for 2-3 minutes, or until the tomato paste takes on a deep burgundy color. Add the onion and salt and continue to sauté for a few minutes more, or until the onions become soft and transparent.
step 3:
Meanwhile, drain and rinse the cannellini beans in a colander. Add the diced tomatoes (with juices), cannellini beans, spinach, and uncooked rice to the pot. Pour in the vegetable broth and stir briefly to combine the ingredients.
step 4:
Place a lid on the pot and turn the heat up to medium-high. Allow the contents to come up to a boil. Once it reaches a boil, turn the heat down to the lowest setting that allows the liquid to maintain a simmer. Let the pot simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until most of the liquid is absorbed (there may still be some around the edges. Turn the heat off and let the pot rest, undisturbed, for 10 additional minutes.
step 5:
Finally, fluff the contents of the pot with a fork, making sure to not stir vigorously. Serve immediately.

Allow the beef to cook with the lid closed, opening it briefly to stir and break up the meat every couple of minutes, until the beef is fully browned (about 5 minutes total). Many rice cookers, including the model I used, do not heat unless the lid is closed, so remember to close it after each stir.
step 1:
If you are using a higher fat content beef, drain the excess fat once it has fully browned. Add the chili powder, cumin, cayenne, garlic powder, onion powder, brown sugar, salt, and pepper to the ground beef in the rice cooker, stir to combine, then close the lid and cook for one minute more.
step 2:
Drain the can of kidney beans and add them to the rice cooker along with the diced tomatoes (and their juices), tomato paste, and water. Stir until everything is evenly combined.
step 3:
Close the lid once more, make sure "white rice" or "cook" is selected, then let the chili simmer for 30 minutes. Stir the chili occasionally to make sure it is not sticking on the bottom. If your cooker finishes the cook cycle before 30 minutes is up, simply begin it again.
step 4:
After simmering for 30 minutes, taste the chili, adjust the seasoning if desired, then serve with your favorite chili toppings.

	amount: n/a
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Add the sausage to a large soup pot and sauté over medium heat, breaking it up into small pieces as it cooks. The sausage should contain enough fat to keep it from sticking, if not add a touch of olive oil. It's okay if a small amount browns on the bottom of the pot.
step 1:
While the sausage is cooking, dice the onion and mince the garlic. Add the onion and garlic to the pot and sauté until the onions are softened. The moisture from the onions should help dissolve any browned bits of sausage off the bottom of the pot.
step 2:
Drain and rinse the can of beans. Add the beans, smoked paprika, chicken broth, one cup water, and half and half to the pot. Place a lid on the pot and let it come up to a simmer over medium heat.
step 3:
While the pot is heating, cut each potato into quarters lengthwise, then slice across into thin, 1/8-inch thick slices. Add the potatoes to the pot along with the pre-chopped kale. The kale will fill the pot when it's first added, but the heat from the liquid will wilt it within a few minutes. Stir it occasionally to help the wilting process.
step 4:
Let the pot simmer over medium heat for about 15 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender. Season with red pepper flakes and freshly cracked black pepper if desired.

	name: Roma tomatoes 
	amount: 2
	unit: n/a
	name: bunch fresh parsley 
	amount: 1/4
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Prepare the marinade by stirring together the olive oil, brown sugar, balsamic vinegar, soy sauce, minced garlic, and some freshly cracked pepper (about 10-15 cranks of a pepper mill).
step 1:
Place the chicken thighs in a gallon-size zip top bag or a shallow dish and pour the marinade over top. Stir to coat the chicken in the marinade. Marinate the chicken in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to 8 hours, turning occasionally to redistribute the marinade.
step 2:
When ready to cook the chicken, heat a large skillet over medium flame. When the skillet is hot, carefully take the chicken thighs out of the marinade and place them in the hot skillet. Cook the chicken thighs until cooked through and browned on each side (about 5 minutes each side). While the chicken is cooking, slice the mozzarella into six pieces, slice the tomatoes (at least 12 slices), and roughly chop the parsley.
step 3:
Once the chicken is cooked through, remove it to a clean plate. Pour the remaining marinade into the skillet and let it boil over medium heat, stirring often, until it has reduced to a thick and rich glaze.
step 4:
Turn the heat under the skillet down to medium-low, return the chicken to the skillet, and spoon some of the glaze over each piece. Place a slice of mozzarella on top of each piece of chicken, followed by two slices of tomato. Place a lid on the skillet and let it heat through until the mozzarella is melted. Top the chicken with the chopped fresh parsley, then serve.

	amount: n/a
	unit: n/a
	name: Handful fresh cilantro 
	amount: n/a
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Begin by pressing the tofu. Remove the tofu from the package, draining away all moisture. Wrap the tofu in a clean, lint-free dish towel or a few layers of paper towel. Place the wrapped tofu between two plates and place something heavy on top (cast iron pan or pot full of water). Let the tofu press for at least 30 minutes.
step 1:
To make the Savory Coconut Rice, combine the uncooked rice, minced garlic, salt, coconut milk, and water in a medium pot. Place a lid on the pot and bring to a boil over high heat. Once it reaches a boil, turn the heat down to low and let simmer for 20 minutes. Turn the heat off and let the pot sit, undisturbed, for 10 more minutes. Fluff the rice with a fork and set aside.
step 2:
While the rice is cooking, prepare the honey lime glaze. Use a zester, microplane, or small-holed cheese grater to remove the thin layer of green zest from the lime. Squeeze the juice from the lime into a separate bowl (you'll need about 1/4 cup juice). Combine the juice with 1/2 tsp of the zest, honey, soy sauce, and corn starch in a bowl. Stir until the corn starch and honey are dissolved.
step 3:
After the tofu has been pressed, cut it into 1/2 inch cubes. Blot with a paper towel if needed to make sure the surface is dry. Season the tofu with a pinch of salt. Sprinkle the corn starch over top and gently toss until all the pieces are well coated.
step 4:
Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat until the oil is shimmering. Add the tofu and fry on until golden brown on each side (about 3 minutes each side). Remove the fried tofu from the pan and turn the heat down to low. While the tofu fries, cut the mango into cubes.
step 5:
Give the prepared glaze a quick stir, then add it to the skillet. Allow the glaze to begin to simmer, at which point it will thicken. Once thickened, turn the heat off and add the fried tofu and cubed mango. Toss to coat in the glaze.
step 6:
To build the bowls, place about one cup of the savory coconut rice in the bottom of each bowl, then top with a scoop of the mango and tofu. Add sliced green onions, sliced avocado, a pinch of red pepper flakes, and a few sprigs of cilantro on top of each bowl.

step 0:
Finely dice the onion. Add the olive oil, onion, and ground beef to a large deep skillet and sauté over medium heat until the beef is fully browned and the onion is soft and transparent. Drain off any excess fat, if needed.
step 1:
Add the flour to the skillet and continue to stir and cook for one minute more. The flour will form a paste that may coat the bottom of the skillet. Be careful not to let the flour burn.
step 2:
Add the tomato sauce, broth, and pasta to the skillet. Stir to combine the ingredients and dissolve any of the flour off the bottom of the skillet.
step 3:
Place a lid on the skillet, turn the heat up to medium-high, and let the liquid come up to a boil. Once it reaches a boil, give it a quick stir, replace the lid, and turn the heat down to medium-low. Let the pasta simmer, stirring occasionally, for 10-12 minutes, or until the pasta is tender and the sauce has thickened. Turn the heat off.
step 4:
Add the cheddar, a handful at a time, and stir until it has melted into the sauce. Stir the hot dog relish into the sauce and then top with sliced green onions. Serve hot.

	unit: oz.
step 0:
Add the brown sugar, rice vinegar, ketchup, water, soy sauce, and cornstarch to a bowl and whisk until the sugar and cornstarch are dissolved. Set the sauce aside.
step 1:
Season the pork chops with a pinch of salt and pepper on each side.
step 2:
Preheat a large skillet over medium, or just slightly above medium. Once the skillet is nice and hot, add the cooking oil and swirl to coat the surface. Add the pork chops and cook for about 5 minutes on each side, or until they are nicely browned. Remove the pork chops to a clean plate and cover with a second plate (turned upside down) to keep them warm.
step 3:
Add the frozen vegetables to the skillet and continue to cook and stir over medium for about two minutes, or just long enough to take some of the ice off (they may still be icy in the center). Give the sauce a brief stir in case any of the cornstarch has settled, then add it to the skillet with the vegetables. Continue to cook and stir until the sauce begins to simmer, at which point it will thicken and go from a cloudy brown to a shiny glaze.
step 4:
Add the cooked pork chops back to the skillet with the vegetables and sauce. Let the pork chops simmer in the sauce for 2-3 minutes more, or until the internal temperature reaches 145ºF. Serve hot, over rice or noodles.

step 0:
Sauté the cabbage with 1 Tbsp canola or vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat until wilted to half its volume. Transfer the cabbage to a large bowl.
step 1:
Slice the green onions, mince the garlic, and grate or chop the ginger. Add the onions, garlic, ginger, soy sauce, sesame oil, and ground pork to the bowl with the sautéed cabbage. Massage the mixture with your hands until it is evenly mixed and slightly sticky or tacky in texture.
step 2:
Spoon about one teaspoon of the pork mixture into the center of a wrapper. Dip a finger in water and wet the outer rim of the wrapper. Fold the wrapper over the filling and pinch the edges to close (here is a video demonstrating different folding styles).
step 3:
When ready to cook the gyoza, heat 1 Tbsp canola or vegetable oil in a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Working in batches, add the gyoza with the seam side up, and fry until the bottom is golden brown and crispy. Using the lid as a shield, pour about 1/4 to 1/3 cup water into the skillet and quickly place the lid on top to contain the steam and splatter. Let the gyoza steam in the skillet for 1-2 minutes, or until most of the liquid has boiled away. Remove the lid and let the gyoza cook for a minute more, or until the bottom is crispy again. Serve hot.

	name: (approx.) all-purpose flour 
	amount: 3
	unit: cups
	name: grated Parmesan 
	amount: 1/4
	unit: cup
step 0:
Prepare the tomato sauce first, so that it has time to cool. In a small skillet combine the olive oil, garlic, oregano, basil, thyme, rosemary, red pepper, cracked pepper, and salt. Heat the oil and herbs over medium-low for 2-3 minutes to gently infuse the oil with flavor. It's okay for the herbs to sizzle, but do not let them burn.
step 1:
Add the tomato paste and honey to the skillet. Stir and cook for 3-5 minutes more, or until the tomato paste becomes a deep red color. The tomato paste and oil will not create a smooth sauce, but will stay fairly separated. Let the sauce cool.
step 2:
While the sauce is cooling, stir the yeast and sugar into one cup of warm water. Let the mixture sit for about 5 minutes, or until it develops a thick layer of foam on top.
step 3:
In a large bowl, stir together one cup of the flour with the salt. Add the olive oil to the yeast mixture, then pour it into the bowl with the flour and stir until it forms a smooth paste. Continue to add flour, 1/2 cup at a time, to the bowl until it forms a sticky ball of dough that you can no longer stir with a spoon.
step 4:
Liberally dust a clean work surface with flour and transfer the sticky dough from the bowl to the work surface. Knead the dough for about 5 minutes, slowly adding more flour as you go, until a smooth ball of dough has formed and you've used about 3 cups of flour total (from beginning to end). Let the dough rest for 5 minutes.
step 5:
Use a bench scraper or sharp knife to cut the dough into 1-inch chunks. Place the cut dough into a clean bowl, add the cooled tomato sauce, and grated Parmesan. Toss the dough pieces in the sauce and cheese until everything is evenly coated. If the dough pieces stick together before they get coated in the sauce, simply pull them apart.
step 6:
Coat a 9-inch pie plate or bread loaf pan with non-stick spray. Place the sauce coated bread pieces in the prepared dish. Cover loosely with plastic and let the bread rise for one hour, or until double in size.
step 7:
Preheat the oven to 350ºF. Bake the bread for 23-25 minutes, or until the top has darkened slightly and the bread sounds hollow when tapped with your finger. Let the bread cool slightly, then serve.

	name: Pinch of salt and pepper 
	amount: n/a
	unit: n/a
	name: grape or cherry tomatoes 
	amount: 1
	unit: pint
step 0:
Prepare the chimichurri by washing the parsley and cilantro leaves well, then shaking off as much water as possible. Pull the leaves from the stems and add them to a food processor, along with the olive oil, vinegar, garlic, oregano, cumin, red pepper, and salt. Pulse the mixture until smooth. (Or finely mince the parsley, cilantro, and garlic with a knife and stir together with the remaining ingredients.)
step 1:
Cook the orzo according to the package directions, drain in a colander, and then let cool.
step 2:
Slice the zucchini into 1/4 inch thick rounds. The zucchini can be added to the salad raw, grilled, or roasted in the oven first. I used a countertop grill to grill the slices, then cut them into quarter rounds after grilling. If roasting in the oven, toss with a little oil, a pinch of salt and pepper, then roast at 400 degrees for about 20 minutes. Let the zucchini cool slightly.
step 3:
While the zucchini and pasta are cooling, slice the grape tomatoes in half. Once the zucchini and orzo are no longer steaming hot, combine them in a bowl with the tomatoes. Pour about half of the chimichurri over top, and then toss until everything is coated. Add more chimichurri to your liking (I used about 3/4 of the batch). Taste and add salt or pepper to the salad if needed.

	amount: 1/2
	unit: tsp
	name: Freshly cracked pepper 
	amount: n/a
	unit: n/a
step 0:
To make the toasted bread crumbs, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once the oil is shimmering, add the bread crumbs, salt, oregano, and some freshly cracked pepper. Cook and stir the bread crumbs continuously until they achieve a deep golden color. Remove them from the skillet and let cool until ready to use.
step 1:
To make the sauce, mince the garlic and add it to a large deep skillet with the butter. Sauté the garlic in the butter over medium heat for about a minute, or just until it becomes fragrant. Add the can of tomatoes, along with all the juices, and some freshly cracked pepper. Break the tomatoes up into a few chunks with your spoon (they should be soft and easily crushed).
step 2:
Stir the ingredients in the skillet, then let it come up to a simmer. Once it reaches a simmer, reduce the heat to medium-low and let it continue to simmer, without a lid, for about 30 minutes. Stir the sauce occasionally as it simmers, breaking the tomatoes into smaller pieces as you stir.
step 3:
While the sauce simmers, cook the pasta according to the package directions. Save about 1/2 cup of the starchy cooking water before draining the pasta in a colander.
step 4:
After simmering for 30 minutes, the sauce should have thickened and become slightly less acidic and slightly more sweet. Season the sauce with a final 1/2 tsp of salt (or to your liking). Add the cooked and drained pasta to the sauce and toss to coat. Use some of the reserved starchy cooking water to loosen the pasta if it becomes too dry. Top the pasta and sauce with a generous sprinkle of toasted bread crumbs, then serve.

	name: sesame seeds 
	amount: 1/2
	unit: Tbsp
	name: green onions 
	amount: 2
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Remove any wilted leaves from the outside of the cabbage. Cut the cabbage into quarters and remove the core. Thinly slice or shred half of the cabbage, or until you have 4-5 cups shredded cabbage. Peel the carrot and shred it using a large-holed cheese grater. Slice the green onions.
step 1:
In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, water, soy sauce, and sesame oil until smooth. Begin whisking in the flour, 1/4 cup at a time, until it forms a thick, smooth batter (about 3/4 to1 cup total flour).
step 2:
Add the cabbage, carrots, and green onion to the batter and stir until the vegetables are mixed and everything is evenly coated in batter.
step 3:
Heat 1/2 Tbsp oil in a non-stick or cast iron skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add 3/4 cup of the vegetable and batter mixture. Press it down into the hot skillet to form a circle, about 6 inches in diameter and 1/2 inch thick. Place a cover on the skillet to hold in the steam, which will help the cabbage soften as it cooks. Cook the pancake until golden brown on the bottom (3-5 minutes), then flip and cook until golden brown on the second side. Pile the cooked pancakes on a plate and cover with foil to keep warm until ready to eat. Add more oil to the skillet as needed as you cook the pancakes.
step 4:
To prepare the sriracha mayo, mix together 1/4 cup mayonnaise and 2 Tbsp sriracha in a small bowl. Drizzle the sriracha mayo over the pancakes just before serving, followed with a sprinkle of sesame seeds and sliced green onion.

	name: tortilla chip strips*
	amount: 5
	unit: cups
	name: green onions
	amount: 2
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Place the chicken breasts on a cutting board, cover with plastic wrap, and use a mallet or rolling pin to pound the chicken to an even thickness, about 3/4 to 1-inch thick. Season both sides of the chicken breasts with chili powder.
step 1:
Heat the cooking oil in a large skillet over medium. Once hot, swirl the oil to coat the surface of the skillet, then add the seasoned chicken breast. Cook the chicken until browned on each side and cooked through, about 5 minutes each side. Remove the chicken to a clean cutting board to cool.
step 2:
While the chicken is cooking, finely dice the onion and bell pepper, and shred the cheddar cheese. Begin to preheat the oven to 375ºF. 
step 3:
After removing the chicken from the skillet, add the butter, onion, and bell pepper. Sauté the onion and bell pepper in the butter over medium heat until the onions are soft and translucent.
step 4:
Add the flour to the skillet with the onion and bell pepper. Continue to sauté for about one minute more, or until the flour coats the bottom of the skillet and turns golden brown.
step 5:
Add the chicken broth to the skillet and stir to dissolve the flour and any browned bits of chicken from the bottom of the skillet. Allow the broth come up to a simmer, at which point it will thicken to a gravy. Remove the skillet from the heat.
step 6:
Drain the can of diced tomatoes with green chiles well. Dice the cooked chicken. Stir the chicken and tomatoes into the gravy. 
step 7:
After stirring the chicken and tomatoes into the gravy, add the sour cream and 1/2 cup of the shredded cheddar, and stir until combined.
step 8:
Layer a few handfuls of the tortilla chip strips into the bottom of a 9x13-inch or 3 quart casserole dish. Spoon half of the chicken mixture on top of the chips. Layer more tortilla chip strips on top (about half as much as before), then spoon the remaining chicken mixture on top. Finally, add the remaining 1.5 cups of shredded cheddar.
step 9:
Bake the casserole in the preheated 375ºF oven for 15 minutes or until the cheese is melted and the casserole bubbles around the edges. Sprinkle sliced green onions on top after baking, then serve hot.

step 0:
Rinse the quinoa under cool running water. Place the rinsed quinoa in a pot with 1.75 cups of water. Put a lid on top, bring it to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to low and let simmer for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, turn off the heat. Allow the quinoa to cool before making the salad or else the heat will wilt the parsley and vegetables. To cool it faster, spread it out on a baking sheet and place in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
step 1:
While the quinoa is cooling, prepare the rest of the salad. To make the dressing, squeeze the juice from the lemon into a bowl (about 1/4 cup). Mince the garlic and add to the lemon juice along with the olive oil and salt. Whisk to combine, then set the dressing aside.
step 2:
Dice the tomato and cucumber. Rinse the parsley well to remove sand and grit, then chop well. Add the cucumber, tomato, and parsley to a large bowl.
step 3:
Once the quinoa is cooled, add it to the bowl with the vegetables. Pour the dressing over top, then stir until everything is well coated. Serve immediately or refrigerate until you're ready to eat. Give the salad a brief stir just before serving.

	unit: n/a
	name: feta
	amount: 2
	unit: oz
step 0:
Place the chopped walnuts in a large skillet and toast them over medium-low heat, stirring often, until they smell toasty (1-2 minutes). Remove them from the skillet to a medium bowl.
step 1:
Add the olive oil and minced garlic to the skillet and turn the heat up to medium. Sauté the garlic for about one minute, or just until it has softened and smells very fragrant. Add the frozen broccoli florets to the skillet with the garlic (no need to thaw) and sauté for about two minutes more, or just until the broccoli is thawed through. Remove the broccoli to the bowl with the walnuts.
step 2:
Slice the sun dried tomatoes into small pieces or strips. Add the pasta, vegetable broth, sun dried tomatoes, about 1 Tbsp of the juice from the lemon, and a pinch of red pepper flakes to the skillet, and stir to combine (the broth will not fully cover the pasta and that is okay). Place a lid on the skillet and turn the heat up to high. Allow the broth to come up to a boil, give the pasta a stir, replace the lid, turn the heat down to low, and let it simmer for 7-10 minutes or until the pasta is tender and most of the broth has been absorbed. Stir the pasta every few minutes as it simmers, replacing the lid quickly every time to maintain the simmer.
step 3:
While the pasta simmers, use a zester or small-holed cheese grater to remove the zest from the lemon. Once the pasta is tender and only a small amount of saucy liquid remains in the bottom of the skillet, return the broccoli and walnuts to the skillet and stir to combine. Top with crumbled feta and zest from the lemon and serve.

step 0:
In a medium bowl, stir together the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt for the quick pickled cucumbers. Thinly slice the cucumber, add them to the bowl with the vinegar dressing, and toss to coat. Let the cucumbers marinate, stirring occasionally, as you prepare the rest of the dish. They should soften and release water as they marinate.
step 1:
Prepare the marinade for the mushrooms. In a medium bowl stir together the gochujang, soy sauce, water, brown sugar, and rice vinegar. Stir until the gochujang and brown sugar are dissolved.
step 2:
Clean each portobello mushroom to remove any dirt or debris. Cut each cap in half, then slice crosswise into thin strips. Place the mushroom strips into a shallow dish and pour the gochujang marinade over top. Gently stir the mushrooms to coat in the marinade, taking care not to break them. Let the mushrooms marinade for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
step 3:
While the mushrooms are marinating, shred the carrot using a cheese grater. Thinly slice the yellow onion and slice the green onions.
step 4:
Add the cooking oil to a large skillet and heat over medium. Once hot, add the sliced yellow onion and sauté for about two minutes, or just until the onion begins to soften. 
step 5:
Add the marinade mushrooms and all of the gochujang marinade to the skillet. Continue to cook the mushrooms and onion over medium until the mushrooms have softened and the liquid in the skillet reduces to a slightly thickened sauce (about 8 minutes).
step 6:
To build the bowls add about 1 cup cooked rice to each bowl then top with 1/4 of the gochujang mushrooms, 1/4 of the pickled cucumbers, and 1/4 of the shredded carrot. Sprinkle sliced green onions over top, then serve.

	unit: Tbsp
step 0:
Add the ground turkey, sage, thyme, garlic powder, smoked paprika, maple syrup, salt, and some freshly cracked pepper to a bowl. Use your hands to mix the ingredients together until the ground turkey is evenly seasoned.
step 1:
Using a 1/4 cup measuring cup, portion and shape the ground meat mixture into patties. After measuring out 1/4 cup, make sure to flatten the patties until they are very thin, as they'll shrink inward and get thicker in the center as they cook. The shaped patties should be about 3-inches wide.
step 2:
To cook the Maple Sage Breakfast Sausage, add 1 Tbsp cooking oil to a skillet and heat over medium. Once hot, add the sausage patties (working in two batches if needed to prevent over crowding the skillet) and cook 3-5 minutes on each side, or until browned on the outside and cooked through. Serve hot.

step 0:
Place the potatoes in a pot and add 1/4 tsp salt and enough water to cover the potatoes by one inch. Place a lid on the pot, turn the heat on to high, and allow the water to come to a boil. Boil the potatoes for 8-10 minutes, or until they are fork tender.
step 1:
While the potatoes are boiling, prepare the Lemon Dill Tahini Dressing. Add the garlic powder, onion powder, dried dill, dried parsley, salt, some freshly cracked pepper (about 10 cranks of a pepper mill), tahini, water, and lemon juice to a bowl. Stir or whisk until smooth. If the dressing is too runny, place it in the refrigerator and it will thicken as it chills.
step 2:
Drain the potatoes and let them cool for 5 minutes, or until they are cool enough to handle. Once slightly cooled, slice the potatoes in half.
step 3:
Add 2 Tbsp cooking oil to a non-stick skillet (I prefer cast iron for this recipe). Heat the oil over medium-high. Once hot, add the potatoes. Let the potatoes cook, stirring only occasionally, until they are browned and crispy on the outside (about 10 minutes total).
step 4:
While the potatoes are frying in the skillet, slice the green onions.
step 5:
Remove the skillet from the heat and either transfer the potatoes to a serving dish or use the skillet as the serving dish. Drizzle a generous amount of the lemon dill tahini dressing over top, then add the green onions. Serve immediately.

step 0:
Add the olive oil and sausage to a large soup pot (if your sausage is in casings, squeeze it out of the casing). Sauté the sausage over medium heat, breaking it up into pieces as you stir, until it is browned and cooked through.
step 1:
While the sausage is cooking, dice the onion and mince the garlic. Add the onion and garlic to the pot and continue to sauté until the onions are soft and transparent.
step 2:
While the onions are sautéing, peel and slice the carrots. Add the carrots to the pot and sauté for just a few minutes more.
step 3:
Finally, add the stewed tomatoes (with all the juices from the can), basil, oregano, and some freshly cracked pepper. Use your spoon to break the tomatoes into smaller pieces.
step 4:
Add the vegetable broth and water to the pot. Place a lid on top, turn the heat up to high, and bring it up to a rolling boil. Once boiling, add the tortelloni, and continue to boil until the tortelloni is tender (about 8 minutes).
step 5:
Turn the heat off, add the spinach, and stir until the spinach has wilted. Taste the soup and add salt if needed (I did not add any, but it will depend on the salt content of the broth you use).

Spread the asparagus spears out over half of a large baking sheet. Add the grape tomatoes to the other half. Drizzle 1 Tbsp olive oil over each side. Toss the vegetables to coat in the oil.
step 2:
Add the minced garlic to the tomatoes and toss to combine. Add a generous pinch of salt and pepper to each of the vegetables.
step 3:
Roast the vegetables for 20 minutes, then give them a stir. Return the vegetables to the oven and roast for another 10 minutes. Stir again, then continue to roast, checking every five minutes, until the vegetables have reached your desired level of doneness (35 minutes total roasting time for me). If one vegetable finishes before the other, simply remove it from the baking sheet and finish roasting the other.
step 4:
After roasting, taste the vegetables and season one last time with a pinch of salt and pepper.

	unit: tsp
step 0:
Dice the onion and slice the carrots and celery. Wash the potatoes well and cut them into one inch cubes. Place the onion, carrots, celery, and potatoes into a large slow cooker.
step 1:
Place the stew meat in a large bowl and season liberally with salt and pepper. Add the flour and toss the meat until it is coated. Set the floured meat aside.
step 2:
Heat the olive oil in a large heavy skillet over medium heat. Sauté the garlic in the hot oil for about one minute, or until soft and fragrant. Add the floured meat and all the flour from the bottom of the bowl to the skillet. Let the beef cook without stirring for a few minutes to allow it to brown on one side. Stir and repeat until most or all sides of the beef pieces are browned. Add the browned beef to the slow cooker and stir to combine with the vegetables.
step 3:
Return the skillet to the burner and turn the heat down to low. Add the beef broth, Dijon, Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, brown sugar, rosemary, and thyme to the skillet. Stir to combine the ingredients and dissolve the browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. Once everything is dissolved off the bottom of the skillet, pour the sauce over the ingredients in the slow cooker. The sauce will not cover the contents of the slow cooker, but it's okay. More moisture will be released as it cooks.
step 4:
Place the lid on the slow cooker and cook on high for four hours. After four hours, remove the lid and stir the stew, breaking the beef into smaller pieces as you stir. Taste the stew and adjust the salt if needed. Serve hot as is, or over a bowl of rice or pasta.

step 0:
Mince the garlic and dice the onion. Add both to a large soup pot along with the olive oil and sauté over medium heat until the onions are soft and transparent.
step 1:
While the onions and garlic are cooking, peel and slice the carrots, slice the celery, and dice the bell pepper. Add the carrots, celery, bell pepper, and frozen green beans to the pot, followed by the diced tomatoes (and their juices) and tomato sauce. Stir to combine.
step 2:
Allow the vegetables in the pot to heat while you chop the cabbage. Chop the cabbage into one-inch strips or squares, then add them to the pot. Add the vegetable broth, chopped parsley, paprika, oregano, thyme, and some freshly cracked pepper. Stir to combine.
step 3:
Place a lid on the pot and bring it up to a boil. Once boiling, turn the heat down to medium-low and allow the pot to simmer until the cabbage is tender (about 20 minutes). Turn off the heat and add salt to taste. Start with about 1/2 tsp salt and add more as needed. The total amount will vary depending on your tastes and the type of broth used, but the salt is crucial for the vegetable flavors to pop. Finish the soup with lemon juice. Start by stirring in one tablespoon and adding more to your liking.

step 0:
Preheat the oven to 400ºF. Wash your potatoes well, then cut them into 3/4-inch cubes or pieces.
step 1:
Place the potatoes in a large bowl and add the olive oil, minced garlic, dried rosemary, salt, and some freshly cracked pepper (about 15 cranks of a pepper mill). Toss the potatoes until they are evenly coated in oil and spices.

	unit: oz.
	name: frozen green beans*
	amount: 20
	unit: oz
	name: French fried onions**
	amount: 3
	unit: oz.
step 0:
Wash the mushrooms then roughly chop them into small pieces. Mince the garlic. Begin preheating the oven to 350ºF.
step 1:
Heat a large skillet over medium, then add the olive oil. Swirl to coat the surface of the skillet, then add the mushrooms, garlic, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Sauté the mushrooms until they release all their moisture, the skillet dries up again, and the edges of the mushrooms begin to brown slightly (7-10 minutes).
step 2:
Add the butter and flour the skillet with the mushrooms. Continue to sauté for 2-3 minutes, or just until the flour begins to coat the bottom of the skillet and turns golden brown.
step 3:
Whisk the vegetable broth into the skillet until all of the flour has dissolved off the bottom of the skillet. Allow the broth to come to a simmer as you whisk, at which point it will thicken. 
step 4:
When the liquid in the skillet has thickened, whisk in the milk. Allow the mixture to return to a simmer after adding the milk, then add the cream cheese (cut into small chunks). Continue to whisk and cook until the cream cheese has fully melted into the sauce. Taste the sauce and add another pinch of salt and pepper if needed. You want the sauce to be slightly over seasoned so the flavor doesn't get too diluted once the green beans are added.
step 5:
Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in the green beans (no need to thaw). The cold beans will thicken the sauce considerably. Transfer the beans and sauce to a 2-3 quart casserole dish. Top with the fried onions and transfer to the oven.
step 6:
Bake the Green Bean Casserole for 20-25 minutes, or until heated through and the fried onions on top have browned slightly. Serve warm.

step 0:
Preheat the oven to 350ºF. In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, salt, and pepper.
step 1:
Thaw the spinach (I used the microwave), then squeeze out the excess moisture. Take the peppers out of the liquid in the jar, then slice into thin strips. Cut the pepper strips crosswise into smaller pieces. Stir the spinach and peppers into the egg mixture.
step 2:
Coat an 8x9 or 8x12 inch casserole dish with nonstick spray. Pour the egg and vegetable mixture into the dish. Bake the eggs for about 30 minutes, or until the center is set and the outer edges are slightly browned. Allow the eggs to cool, then slice into six pieces.
step 3:
Build the sandwiches by adding one piece of the baked eggs and one slice of cheese to each English muffin. Wrap each sandwich in plastic wrap or a fold top sandwich bag, then place all the sandwiches in a gallon sized freezer bag. Freeze for up to 2 months.
step 4:
To reheat, unwrap the sandwich, place on a microwave safe plate, then microwave on the defrost setting for one minute. Following the defrost, heat on high for 30 seconds at a time until heated through. Or, thaw in the refrigerator over night and simply microwave on high until heated through.

step 0:
Mince the garlic and grate the ginger using a fine holed cheese grater or box grater. In a small bowl stir together the brown sugar, soy sauce, garlic, ginger, some freshly cracked pepper (about 15 cranks of a pepper mill), and cooking oil. Place the chicken thighs in a shallow dish or a gallon size zip lock bag. Pour the marinade over the chicken and turn to coat. Cover the chicken and marinate for at least 30 minutes or up to a day (refrigerated).
step 1:
When ready to cook the chicken, heat a large skillet over medium flame. Once hot, add 1/2 Tbsp cooking oil and swirl to coat the bottom of the skillet. Add half of the chicken pieces and let cook until well browned on each side and cooked through. Remove the cooked chicken to a clean plate, then repeat with the second batch.
step 2:
Once all the chicken has been removed from the skillet, pour the leftover marinade into the skillet and allow it to come up to a boil. Whisk the marinade as it boils to dissolve any browned bits from the skillet. Let it continue to boil until it reduces to a thick glaze*. Turn the heat off, add the cooked chicken back to the skillet, and dredge it in the thick glaze. Garnish with sliced green onions and sesame seeds if desired.

	name: egg, lightly beaten
	amount: 1
	unit: large
	name: butter
	amount: 2
	unit: Tbsp
step 0:
Preheat the oven to 400ºF. Place the dry stuffing mix in a large bowl, add the hot water, and stir until no more water pools on the bottom of the bowl. Let the stuffing sit for another 5 minutes to further soften. (Less water is added to the stuffing mix than is listed on the box in order to leave room for the absorption of moisture from the turkey and egg.)
step 1:
Add the ground turkey and beaten egg to the bowl with the partially hydrated stuffing mix. Combine these ingredients by hand until they are evenly mixed. Form the mixture into 20 meatballs, slightly larger than ping pong balls, or about 3 Tbsp each.
step 2:
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, then place the meatballs on the parchment. Bake the meatballs for 20 minutes in the preheated oven.
step 3:
Melt 1 Tbsp butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add half of the baked meatballs and allow them to cook in the butter until browned on most sides (about 5 minutes). Transfer the browned meatballs to a serving dish, add a second tablespoon of butter to the skillet, and repeat with the second batch of meatballs. 
step 4:
Serve warm over a bed of mashed potatoes or with gravy or cranberry sauce for dipping.

step 0:
Fill a pot with water and add two large pinches of salt. Cover the pot and bring it to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, add the pasta and continue to boil until the pasta is tender. Drain the pasta in a colander, give it a brief rinse with cool water, and let it drain well while you prepare the rest of the salad.
step 1:
While waiting for the pasta to cook, prepare the rest of the salad. Start with the Parmesan Balsamic Vinaigrette. Combine all the dressing ingredients in a jar or blender. Either blend until combined or shake your jar until the ingredients are well combined. Set the dressing aside until needed.
step 2:
Roughly chop the spinach and slice the grape tomatoes in half. Dice the mozzarella into 1/2-inch cubes. 
step 3:
Add the spinach, tomatoes, and mozzarella to a large bowl. Once the pasta is well drained and mostly cool, add it to the bowl with the mozzarella and vegetables. Make sure the pasta is no longer hot, so it doesn't wilt the spinach or melt the cheese. 
step 4:
Toss the ingredients to combine. If serving the salad later, store it like this without dressing. If serving immediately, add half of the dressing and toss to coat. Add more dressing as desired.

	amount: 2
	unit: Tbsp
step 0:
Place the uncooked short grain rice in a medium sauce pot. Cover with cool water, swish the rice around, then carefully pour off the cloudy water. Repeat this rinsing process 3-4 times. Finally, add 2 cups fresh water, place a lid on the pot, and place the pot over high heat. Allow the pot to come to a full boil, then turn the heat down to low and let simmer for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, turn the heat off and let the rice rest, undisturbed and with the lid in place, for 10 additional minutes.
step 1:
While the rice is cooking, prepare the toppings. Shred the crab stick, shred or julienne the carrot, slice the avocado, slice the cucumber, and break the nori into smaller pieces. Stir together the mayonnaise and sriracha in a small bowl.
step 2:
For the sushi rice dressing, combine the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small bowl. Microwave for 15-20 seconds to warm the mixture, then stir until the sugar is fully dissolved.
step 3:
Once the rice is finished cooking, transfer it to a large bowl. Sprinkle about 1/4 of the vinegar dressing over the rice, then gently fold or stir the rice to combine. Repeat the process until all of the vinegar dressing has been incorporated into the rice and the rice has taken on a glossy appearance.
step 4:
To build your sushi bowls, place about 1 cup of the seasoned sushi rice in a bowl, then top with crab stick, carrot, cucumber, avocado, a few pieces of nori, a pinch of sesame seeds, and a drizzle of the sriracha mayo.

step 0:
Prepare the vinaigrette by adding the olive oil, vinegar, mustard, garlic powder, salt, and some freshly cracked pepper to a bowl or jar. Whisk or shake the jar until the ingredients are combined, then set the vinaigrette aside.
step 1:
Slice the kielbasa into medallions or half-rounds and add them to a large skillet (12" or larger) or a large, wide-bottomed pot, along with the olive oil. Sauté the sausage over medium heat until the pieces are well browned.
step 2:
While the sausage is browning, finely dice the onion. Once the sausage has fully browned, add the onions and continue to sauté until the onions are soft and transparent.
step 3:
While the onions are sautéing, chop the head of cabbage into 2-inch by  1/2-inch wide strips. Add the cabbage to the skillet or pot along with a pinch of salt and pepper. Continue to sauté until the cabbage is tender (check the thickest white pieces for tenderness). To help the cabbage soften, add a few tablespoons of water to create steam within the pot or skillet. Let the water evaporate as you sauté the cabbage.
step 4:
Once tender, drizzle the mustard vinaigrette over the skillet, starting with just half of the prepared amount. Stir to coat the kielbasa and cabbage in the vinaigrette, taste, and add more if needed. Serve warm.

	unit: Tbsp
	name: chicken broth*
	amount: 1/2
	unit: cup
	name: capers 
	amount: 1
	unit: Tbsp
step 0:
Prepare the lemon, parsley, and garlic so they’re ready to go when you need them. Roughly chop the parsley leaves, juice the lemon, and mince the garlic. Set these ingredients aside.
step 1:
Trim the chicken breasts of excess fat. Cover them with plastic wrap and pound them with a mallet or rolling pin until they are an even thickness (about 1/2-3/4 inch thick). Cut each chicken breast in half so that you have four to six pieces about the size of the palm of your hand. Season both sides of the chicken pieces with salt and pepper.
step 2:
Heat the olive oil in a heavy skillet, over medium heat. While the oil is heating, place the flour in a bowl and lightly coat each piece of chicken on both sides. When the oil is very hot but not smoking, add the chicken pieces to the skillet and cook until golden brown on each side (about 3-5 minutes on each side). Cook the chicken in batches, if needed, to prevent them from overcrowding the skillet. Transfer the browned chicken on a clean plate.
step 3:
After removing the chicken from the skillet, turn the heat down to medium-low and add the butter and minced garlic. Sauté the garlic in the butter for about one minute. Add the chicken broth and lemon juice to the skillet and whisk to dissolve (or “deglaze”) the brown bits off of the bottom of the pan.
step 4:
Add the capers and half of the chopped parsley to the skillet. Increase the heat to medium, add the chicken back to the skillet, and spoon the sauce over top. Allow the chicken to simmer in the sauce for 3-5 minutes, without a lid, or until the sauce reduces by half. The flour on the chicken will help thicken the sauce as it simmers. Sprinkle the remaining parsley over top just before serving.

	unit: cups
step 0:
Wash and slice the mushrooms. Thinly slice the green onions. Use a vegetable peeler or the side of a spoon to scrape the skin from the ginger, then use a cheese grater to grate about 1 Tbsp.
step 1:
Add the mushrooms, green onions, and ginger to a large soup pot along with 1 Tbsp cooking oil. Sauté the vegetables over medium heat or just until the mushrooms begin to soften.
step 2:
Add 4 cups chicken broth, 2 cups water, and 1 Tbsp soy sauce to the pot. In a small bowl stir together 1 Tbsp cornstarch with 1 Tbsp water until the cornstarch is completely dissolved. Pour the cornstarch slurry into the soup pot and stir to combine.
step 3:
Bring the soup up to a boil over medium-high heat. While waiting for the soup to boil, whisk two eggs in a bowl. Once the soup is boiling, turn the heat down to low and wait until the soup stops boiling. Use a large wooden spoon to stir the pot and make the broth swirl in one direction. While the soup is swirling, slowly pour the whisked eggs into the soup in a thin stream. Let the eggs sit in the hot liquid, undisturbed, for 1-2 minutes to fully set.
step 4:
Finally, add the fresh spinach to the pot and stir until it has wilted. Taste and adjust the salt by adding more soy sauce, if needed. Serve hot.

	amount: 6
	unit: Tbsp
	name: lime
	amount: 1
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Dice the onion and mince the garlic. Add the onion, garlic, chicken breast, chili powder, cumin, smoked paprika, cayenne, some freshly cracked pepper (about 10 cranks of a pepper mill), the fire roasted tomatoes (with juices), diced tomatoes with chiles (with juices), black beans (drained), corn, and chicken broth to the slow cooker.
step 1:
Give everything a brief stir, place the lid on the slow cooker, and cook on high for 4 hours, or low for 8 hours.
step 2:
After cooking on high for 4 hours or low for 8 hours, carefully remove the chicken breast, shred it with a fork, then return it to the soup.
step 3:
To make the tortilla crisps, preheat the oven to 400ºF. Stack the tortillas, then slice them into strips that are approximately 1/4-inch wide and 2 to 3-inches long. Place the strips in a bowl, drizzle with cooking oil, and a pinch of salt. Gently toss the strips until they're completely coated in oil.
step 4:
Spread the oil coated tortilla strips over a baking sheet in a single layer, overlapping as little as possible. Bake them in the preheated oven for 10-15 minutes, stirring once every five minutes, or until they are deeply golden brown and crispy. The total cook time will depend on the size of your strips and how crowded they are on the baking sheet, so watch them closely and adjust the cook time as needed.
step 5:
To serve, ladle the soup into bowls, top with a handful of the tortilla crisps, some chopped cilantro, a few slices of avocado, and a dollop of sour cream. Squeeze a wedge of fresh lime over top just before eating.

	name: boneless, skinless chicken breast (about 2/3 lb.)
	amount: 1
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Preheat the oven to 425ºF. Place a wire cooling rack, or two, over a baking sheet to hold the nuggets as they bake.
step 1:
In a wide shallow bowl, combine the breadcrumbs, garlic powder, smoked paprika, salt, and some freshly cracked pepper (about 5 cranks of a pepper mill). Stir these ingredients together until evenly combined. Drizzle the oil over the breadcrumb mixture, then stir until the breadcrumbs are coated in oil. The breadcrumbs should look like damp sand.
step 2:
In a separate small bowl, stir together the Greek yogurt, salt, and water until smooth. You want the yogurt to be a similar consistency to buttermilk or heavy cream. It should be thick enough to coat the chicken.
step 3:
Trim any excess fat from the chicken breast, then cut it into small, 3/4 to one-inch pieces. For a 2/3 lb. chicken breast you should get about 22-24 pieces. 
step 4:
Dip each piece of chicken into the yogurt slurry, then roll it in the seasoned breadcrumb mixture until the chicken piece is fully coated. Place each coated nugget onto the wire cooling rack on the baking sheet.
step 5:
Once all of the chicken pieces are fully coated, transfer the baking sheet to the oven and bake for 23-25 minutes, or until the breading is browned on the edges. 
step 6:
Remove the chicken nuggets from the oven and let cool for 3-5 minutes, then serve with your favorite dip.

step 0:
Add the ground beef and olive oil to a pot and sauté over medium until the beef is cooked through (about 5 minutes). If you're using a higher fat content beef (10% or higher), you may want to drain the excess fat once the beef has browned.
step 1:
While the beef is cooking, finely dice the onion. Add the diced onion and butter to the cooked beef. Continue to sauté until the onion is soft and translucent (about 5 minutes).
step 2:
Next, add the crushed tomatoes, Italian seasoning blend, and some freshly cracked pepper (10-15 cranks of a pepper mill). Stir everything to combine.
step 3:
Place a lid on the pot and allow it to come up to a simmer. Once simmering, reduce the heat to low and let the sauce simmer for 30 minutes.
step 4:
After a minimum of 30 minutes simmering, add about 1/2 tsp salt, stir to combine, then taste and add more if needed. The flavor of the sauce will deepen and the complexities will pop once the salt is added. Serve over pasta or your favorite roasted vegetables.

step 2:
Remove the skillet from the heat immediately, as the sugar can go from melted to burning quickly. Spread the candied nuts out over a sheet of parchment paper, making sure they are in a flat layer and separated as much as possible.
step 3:
Allow the nuts to cool fully (about 10 minutes). The candy coating will fully harden as they cool.

step 0:
Scrub the potatoes well, then add them to a large pot with enough cool water to cover the potatoes by one inch. Add approximately 1/2 Tbsp salt to the cooking water. Place a lid on the pot, turn the heat on to high, and bring the pot to a boil. Continue to boil the potatoes until they can easily be pierced with a fork (about 15 minutes).
step 1:
Meanwhile, prepare the dressing. In a small bowl stir together the apple cider vinegar, stone ground mustard (or Dijon if preferred), sugar, some freshly cracked pepper, and about 1/2 tsp salt.
step 2:
Cut the bacon into one inch pieces and add them to a large skillet. Sauté the bacon over medium heat until brown and crispy. Remove the bacon from the skillet and place it on a paper towel lined plate to drain. Leave the remaining bacon grease in the skillet.
step 3:
While the bacon is cooking, dice the onion. After removing the bacon, add the onion to the skillet and sauté it in the leftover bacon grease until the onions are soft and transparent. Turn the heat off. Add the prepared dressing and whisk until the dressing is well blended with the bacon fat and it has thickened just slightly.
step 4:
Once the potatoes are tender, drain them in a colander. Let them cool for a few minutes, or just until they are cool enough to handle. Slice the potatoes into 1/4-inch thick medallions or half moons. Add the sliced potatoes, cooked bacon, and chopped parsley to the skillet with the dressing. Stir to combine. Serve immediately while the potatoes are still warm.

step 0:
Pour the black beans into a colander, rinse well and let drain. Add the beans to a food processor along with everything except the salt, egg and bread crumbs [parsley, onion (roughly diced), garlic (minced), sriracha, mayonnaise, worchestershire sauce, cumin and fresh cracked pepper (about 20 cranks)]. Process until everything is combined and the mixture looks pasty with a few chunks. If you don't have a food processor, mash the beans with a fork and stir in the rest of the ingredients. Make sure the onion, garlic and parsley are well chopped
step 1:
Transfer the mixture to a bowl and season with salt. I used about 1 tsp of salt total. Adjust other seasonings at this time as well. Make the mixture slightly stronger in flavor and saltiness than you want the burgers to be because once the bread crumbs and egg are added, the flavor will be diluted.
step 2:
Whisk an egg and stir it into the mixture. Stir in the bread crumbs. The resulting mixture should be moist chunks and crumbs. The mixture should stick together if squeezed in your hand. Adjust the bread crumbs up or down to achieve a mixture that will hold a patty shape.
step 3:
Use your hands for form the patties. Coat a skillet with non-stick spray and cook the patties for 7-8 minutes on each side. The patties should be brown and crisp on the outside and slightly firm to the touch. Be delicate when handling the patties, they are not as cohesive as meat patties but should hold their shape while cooking.

step 0:
Rinse and drain the chickpeas in a colander. Add the chickpeas to a food processor along with the red onion, parsley, cilantro, salt, cayenne, garlic and cumin (all ingredients except baking powder and flour). Process the mixture until it forms a chunky paste. A little texture to the mixture is usually desirable. You may need to scrape down the sides of the bowl occasionally to make sure the mixture is an even texture.
step 1:
Place the mixture into a bowl and stir in the baking powder. Begin adding flour, 2 Tbsp at a time, until the mixture becomes cohesive enough to form into patties. Chickpea or garbanzo bean flour gives the best flavor and texture, but all-purpose can be used in it’s place. Refrigerate the mixture for at least 1 hour to allow the flavors to blend.
step 2:
Using a small measuring cup or scoop (about 1/8th cup or 2 Tbsp), form the falafel dough into small patties. If freezing the patties for later, place them on a parchment lined baking sheet so they can freeze without sticking together. The patties can be transferred to an air-tight container or freezer bag for long-term storage once they have frozen through.
step 3:
To cook the fresh or frozen patties, heat oil in a skillet (or pot if deep frying) until very hot and shimmering, but not smoking. Cook the patties on each side until deep golden brown and crispy. Serve with tzatziki, tahini, hummus or stuffed into a pita.

step 0:
Preheat the oven to 400ºF. In a small bowl combine the olive oil, minced garlic, Italian seasoning, and salt. 
step 1:
Slice each eggplant in half lengthwise, then use a paring knife to score a crosshatch pattern into the flesh (do not pierce the skin). Drizzle the seasoned olive oil over the cut surfaces of the eggplant and smear it around with the back of a spoon.
step 2:
Place the eggplant on a baking sheet, cut sides down, and transfer the baking sheet into the oven. (Coat the baking sheet with non-stick spray for easy cleanup) Roast the eggplant for about 60 minutes, or until they look deflated and the skins appear wrinkly.
step 3:
While the eggplant are roasting, prepare the meat sauce. Add the ground beef and olive oil to a sauce pot and cook over medium heat until the meat has browned. If using a higher fat content beef (90% lean or lower), drain the excess fat from the pot.
step 4:
Dice the onion and add it to the browned beef along with the butter. Sauté over medium heat until the onions are soft and transparent. Add the crushed tomatoes, Italian seasoning, and some freshly cracked pepper. Stir to combine, then allow the sauce to come to a simmer. Once it reaches a simmer, turn the heat down to low and let it simmer until the roasted eggplant are finished, or for a minimum of 30 minutes. Before serving, taste the sauce, and add salt as needed (about 1/2 tsp).
step 5:
When the eggplant are finished roasting, carefully flip them with a spatula (they will be quite soft). Top each eggplant half with a generous ladle of the meat sauce and a dusting of grated parmesan. Serve immediately.

	name: yeast 
	amount: 1

	amount: 1

	amount: 3/4

	amount: 2
	unit: n/a
	name: salt 
	amount: 1 1/2
	unit: tsp
	name: olive oil 
	amount: 1
	unit: Tbsp
step 0:
Combine the yeast, sugar and warm water in a bowl. Stir well to dissolve the yeast and sugar. Let sit for 3-5 minutes to let the yeast bloom (or “wake up”). You’ll see foam on top when it’s awake and ready to go.
step 1:
While you’re waiting for the yeast, combine 2 cups of the flour and salt in a large bowl. Stir well to evenly distribute the salt. Add the olive oil (it will get sired/mixed in during kneading). The remaining half cup of flour was an allowance for what might be added during kneading. In actuality, you probably won’t use a whole half cup.
step 2:
Once the yeast water is foamy on top (see photos below) stir it into the flour mixture. Stir it with a spoon until it forms a loose ball. Turn it out onto a counter and begin to knead the dough. Knead well for 10 minutes. Sprinkle flour on the countertop sparingly as you knead. If you add too much flour the dough will end up dense (more like a bagel) rather than light like a pizza dough. I found that as long as I kept my hands and the dough moving quickly, it did not stick and did not need more flour. If you have never kneaded dough before, watch this video for help.
step 3:
At this point you have three options: use the dough tonight (one hour after kneading), use it tomorrow (allowing it to rise in the refrigerator over night) or within a month (freezing the dough).
step 4:
To use the dough the same day, form the kneaded dough into a ball (or cut and form into four small balls for individual pizzas). Spray a bowl with non stick spray, place the dough inside and turn it to coat with oil. Cover the bowl loosely and let it rise in a warm place for one hour. After it has risen, punch it down to release some gasses and stretch it into a 16″ round.
step 5:
Many people say that the dough develops a better flavor if allowed to proof (rise) slowly over a day or so, either in the refrigerator. Every pizza establishment that I have worked at also made their dough at least one day ahead of time. Form the dough into a ball and coat with oil the same way as in step 4a but place the dough in the refrigerator. The dough can be used up 8-24 hours later.
step 6:
You can also freeze the dough. After forming it into a ball (or multiple smaller balls) coat it with oil, wrap tightly in plastic wrap then place in a freezer bag. When you are ready to use the dough, simply place it on the counter for one hour prior to use. The dough should be at room temperature before you begin to stretch it into shape.
step 7:
Once you stretch the dough into shape, place it on a perforated pizza pan coated with non-stick spray and a light dusting of cornmeal. Bake in a preheated (completely preheated, no short cuts here) oven at 450 degrees for 10-12 minutes or until the edges are brown and crispy. Making sure the oven is well heated before hand will ensure that the bottom cooks and gets nice and crispy.

	unit: cup
	name: mayonnaise
	amount: 1/4
	unit: cup
	name: hot sauce 
	amount: 2
	unit: dashes
step 0:
Make sure the spinach is fully thawed, then squeeze out as much of the excess moisture as possible (I squeeze clumps of it in my fist). Once squeezed, break the spinach up so there are no large clumps. Place the squeeze dried spinach in a large bowl.
step 1:
Drain and roughly chop the artichoke hearts. Place the artichoke hearts in the bowl with the spinach, along with 4 oz. (about 1 cup) of the mozzarella, the grated Parmesan, and red pepper flakes. Stir these ingredients together briefly to combine, then set them aside.
step 2:
Begin preheating the oven to 375ºF. Add the butter and minced garlic to a small sauce pot. Sauté the garlic in the butter over medium-low heat for about two minutes, or just until the garlic becomes very fragrant. Cut the cream cheese into chunks and add it to the sauce pot along with the sour cream and mayonnaise. Heat and whisk these ingredients together for about five minutes, or until they melt together into a smooth sauce. Finally, stir in a couple dashes of hot sauce.
step 3:
Pour the creamy garlic sauce over the spinach artichoke mixture, then stir until everything is evenly combined and coated in sauce. Transfer the mixture to a 2-3 quart casserole dish, then top with the remaining 2 oz. (1/2 cup) shredded mozzarella.
step 4:
Bake the dip for about 35 minutes, or until it is bubbling around the edges and the cheese on top is turning golden brown. Serve while hot.

	name: cooking oil, divided*
	amount: 3
	unit: Tbsp
	name: green onions, sliced
	amount: 2-3
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Line a baking sheet with foil. Pour 1 Tbsp cooking oil into a small dish, dip your fingers into the oil, then rub the outside of the Hatch chiles with oil until they're evenly coated. Save the rest of the 1 Tbsp of oil to coat the skillet.
step 1:
Place the peppers on the baking sheet. Adjust your oven rack so that the top of the peppers will be about 6 inches from the broiler, turn the broiler on to high, and place the peppers in the oven. Broil the peppers, turning them occasionally, until they are blackened on all sides (10-15 minutes).
step 2:
Once the peppers have charred on the outside, remove them from the oven and place an upside down bowl over the peppers to trap the steam. Let them cool under the bowl for about 10 minutes. Once cool enough to touch, peel back the skin of the peppers, cut off the stem, open the peppers lengthwise, and scrape out the seeds. Chop the remaining roasted pepper flesh and set aside.
step 3:
While the peppers are roasting, peel the sweet potato and cut it into 1/2 inch cubes. Place the cubes in a small pot, cover with water, place a lid on top, and bring the water to a boil over high heat. Let the sweet potatoes boil until very tender (about 7 minutes). Drain the potatoes then mash until mostly smooth. Set the mashed sweet potatoes aside.
step 4:
Coat the inside of a 10-inch cast iron skillet with the leftover oil from coating the peppers. Place the skillet in the oven and preheat to 425ºF.
step 5:
While the oven and skillet are preheating, stir together the cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk together 1.5 cups of the mashed sweet potato, eggs, sour cream, milk, and 2 Tbsp of cooking oil until smooth.
step 6:
Pour the bowl of wet ingredients into the bowl of dry ingredients, then stir just until combined and no dry flour remains on the bottom of the bowl. Add the chopped green chiles and sliced green onions, then gently fold until they're incorporated into the batter.
step 7:
Carefully take the preheated skillet out of the oven and pour in the cornbread batter. Smooth the top of the batter, then return the skillet to the oven. Bake the cornbread for 22-26 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and cracked around the edges. Slice the cornbread into eight pieces and serve.

	name: pizza sauce* 
	amount: 1 1/3
	unit: cup
	name: shredded mozzarella 
	amount: 4
	unit: oz.
step 0:
Preheat your oven to 400ºF. Wash the potatoes well and then pat dry with a paper towel. Using a large, sharp knife, cut parallel slits into the potatoes about 1/8th inch apart and about 80% of the way through the potato (see images below for details). Do not cut through the bottom of the potatoes--each potato should still be one piece.
step 1:
Place the sliced potatoes on a baking sheet covered with parchment or foil for easy clean up. Use your hands to rub cooking oil over the entire outside surface of the potatoes. Begin stuffing the slits in the potatoes with slices of pepperoni. Use 8-10 slices of pepperoni per potato, placing a pepperoni in every other or every third slit. Season the potatoes with a pinch of salt and a generous sprinkle of Italian seasoning blend.
step 2:
Bake the potatoes in the preheated oven for 45-60 minutes, or until they are tender all the way through. Remove the potatoes from the oven and pour about 1/3 cup pizza sauce over the top of each potato. Top the sauced potatoes with shredded mozzarella, then return the potatoes to the oven for an additional 7-10 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and slightly golden brown on the edges. Serve hot.

	unit: tsp
	name: garlic powder
	amount: 1/4
	unit: tsp
	name: medium cheddar, shredded
	amount: 6
	unit: oz
step 0:
Preheat the oven to 400ºF. Take the broccoli out of the freezer and allow it to thaw as the potatoes bake. Once thawed, roughly chop the broccoli into small pieces and then set aside until ready to use.
step 1:
Wash the potatoes well, then dry with paper towel or a clean dish towel. Use a fork to prick several holes in the skin of each potato. Pour the olive oil into a small dish, then use your hands to coat each potato in oil. Place the oil coated potatoes on a baking sheet, and season generously with salt. Bake the potatoes for 45-60 minutes, or until tender all the way through.
step 2:
Towards the end of the baking time, begin to prepare the cheese sauce. Add the butter and flour to a medium sauce pot, then place the pot over a medium flame. Whisk the butter and flour together as they melt. Allow the mixture to begin to bubble and foam, whisking continuously. Continue to cook for one minute to remove the raw flour flavor, but do not let the flour begin to brown.
step 3:
Whisk the milk into the butter and flour mixture. Bring the milk up to a simmer, whisking frequently. When it reaches a simmer, it will thicken. Once thick enough to coat a spoon, turn the heat down to the lowest setting. Season the white sauce with the salt and garlic powder.
step 4:
Add a handful of the shredded cheddar to the sauce at a time, whisking until it has fully melted before adding the next handful. Once all of the cheddar has been melted into the sauce, stir in the chopped broccoli. Leave the sauce over a low flame, stirring occasionally, to keep it warm.
step 5:
When the potatoes are finished baking, carefully slice them open. Use a fork to slightly mash the insides of the potatoes. When ready to serve, place each potato on a plate and ladle the broccoli cheese sauce over each potato. Garnish with extra shredded cheddar, if desired.

cook_time: 1
num_servings: 4
ingredients:
	name: whole split chicken (3-4 lbs. total)
	amount: 1
	unit: n/a
	name: (approx.) seasoning blend of choice* 
	amount: 2
	unit: Tbsp
	name: water 
	amount: 2
	unit: cups
	name: long grain white rice 
	amount: 1.5
	unit: cups
	name: Handful parsley (optional)
	amount: n/a
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Season the chicken well on both sides with your favorite spice or seasoning blend. If your sblend blend does not contain salt, season the chicken liberally with salt as well.
step 1:
Add two cups of water to your pressure cooker or slow cooker, then add the chicken pieces (they do not need to be fully submerged).
step 2:
Secure the lid, set the pressure cooker to high pressure. Once it reaches full pressure, cook for 30 minutes. Allow the pressure to release naturally. If using a slow cooker, cook on low heat for 8-9 hours or high heat for 4-5 hours.
step 3:
Once the chicken is finished cooking, carefully lift it out of the cooker and place it on a baking sheet. Adjust your oven rack so that the top of the meat will be 6-8 inches from the broiler. Turn the broiler on to high, place the chicken in the oven, and let it broil for 5-7 minutes or until the chicken skin is brown and crispy. Keep a close eye on the chicken while it's under the broiler, as it can burn quickly.
step 4:
While the chicken is broiling, pour the remaining liquid (broth) from the pressure cooker through a sieve to strain out any bone or skin fragments. Measure the broth to see how much was left behind. You'll want three cups of broth. If you have less, simply add enough water to make three cups of broth total. Taste the broth and adjust the salt if needed.
step 5:
Add the broth plus 1.5 cups of uncooked long grain white rice back to the pressure cooker. Secure the lid and select the rice function. Once the rice had finished cooking, allow the pressure to decrease naturally, open the cooker, then fluff with a fork. If your pressure cooker does not have a "rice" function, you can find manual instructions here. If using a slow cooker, simply cook the rice in the broth on the stove top, following the package instructions.
step 6:
Serve the tender chicken pieces over the cooked rice, with chopped parsley as a garnish (optional). The pressure cooker (or slow cooker) creates extremely tender meat, so the split chicken can be easily broken into pieces (breast, legs, thighs, wings) for serving.

	unit: n/a
	name: large eggs 
	amount: 4
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Begin by preparing the sesame sauce so the flavors have time to mingle. Mince the clove of garlic, then combine it with the soy sauce, sesame oil, rice vinegar, brown sugar, sesame seeds, and red pepper in a small bowl. Set the sauce aside.
step 1:
Begin to boil a large pot of water to cook the pasta. Once boiling, add the pasta and continue to cook until the pasta is tender. Drain the pasta in a colander, then return it to the pot with the heat turned off. Pour the sesame sauce over the pasta, stir to combine, then place a lid on the pot to keep it warm until ready to serve. The pasta will continue to absorb the sauce as it sits.
step 2:
While the pasta is boiling, prepare the wilted greens. Mince the clove of garlic and add it to a large skillet along with the olive oil. Sauté the garlic in the olive oil over medium heat for about one minute, or just until the garlic is fragrant and has softened slightly. Add the spinach and continue to sauté just until it has wilted. The spinach should still be bright green and look slightly plump. Season with salt and pepper and remove from the heat.
step 3:
Prepare the eggs using your favorite method; fried sunny side up, over hard, poached, scrambled, or soft boiled.
step 4:
Give the spaghetti a good stir to redistribute the sesame sauce, then divide between four bowls. Add a scoop of the wilted greens to each bowl, then top with an egg and serve.

step 0:
Wash the zucchini well, then slice each one in half lengthwise. Use a spoon or a melon baller to remove the flesh from the center of the zucchini halves, leaving a 1/4 inch rim around each. Place the scooped out zucchini halves in a 9x13" casserole dish or on a large baking sheet. Roughly chop the scooped out zucchini flesh into small pieces and set aside.
step 1:
Add the olive oil and Italian sausage to a large skillet and sauté over medium heat. Break the sausage up into small pieces as you sauté and cook until the sausage is thoroughly browned (about 5 minutes). Drain off the excess fat.
step 2:
Add the minced garlic and chopped zucchini to the skillet and continue to sauté until the zucchini pieces are soft (about 5 minutes more). Remove the skillet from the heat.
step 3:
Begin to preheat the oven to 375ºF. Transfer the sautéed sausage and zucchini to a large bowl. Add the bread crumbs, 1/2 cup of the shredded cheese, and 1/4 cup of the pasta sauce. Stir until everything is evenly combined. Taste and add a pinch of salt and pepper if needed.
step 4:
Stuff the scooped out zucchini halves with the sausage mixture. Pour the remaining pasta sauce over the zucchini, leaving some of the stuffing exposed so it can brown and crisp up. It's okay if you don't use all the sauce.
step 5:
Bake the zucchini in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until the stuffing is brown and crispy and the zucchini are tender. Add the remaining shredded cheese and continue to bake for 2-3 minutes, or until the cheese is melted. Serve hot.

step 0:
Fill a large pot with water for the pasta and season with salt. Place a lid on the pot and bring it up to a boil over high heat.
step 1:
While waiting for the water to boil, cut the bacon into small pieces. Cook the bacon in a large skillet over medium-low heat until brown and crispy. Remove the cooked bacon from the skillet, then turn the heat down to low. Mince two cloves of garlic, add them to the warm skillet, and sauté for about one minute or until fragrant and softened, then turn off the heat.
step 2:
In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, 1/2 cup of the Parmesan, and a generous dose of freshly cracked pepper.
step 3:
The water should be boiling at this point, so add the pasta, stir well, and continue to boil the pasta until al dente. Reserve one cup of the starchy pasta cooking water, then drain the pasta in a colander.
step 4:
Add 1/4 cup of the reserved pasta water to the skillet that was used to cook the bacon. Stir the warm water in the skillet and dissolve the browned bits from the surface of the skillet. Add the steaming hot drained pasta to the skillet and toss in the bacon liquid in the skillet.
step 5:
Pour the egg and Parmesan mixture over the hot pasta and immediately begin to stir or toss the pasta. Continue to stir the hot pasta in the egg mixture until a creamy sauce forms. Add the remaining Parmesan, a little more freshly cracked pepper, and the reserved bacon bits, and toss again. If the pasta becomes too thick or dry, add a splash more of the reserved pasta water.
step 6:
Finally, taste the pasta and adjust the salt, Parmesan, or pepper if needed. Top with a pinch or two of roughly chopped parsley leaves.

step 0:
Dice the onion and mince the garlic. Peel the carrot, then shred it using a cheese or box grater. Add the onion, garlic, and carrot to the bottom of a 5 quart or larger slow cooker.
step 1:
Use a sharp knife to remove any large pieces of fat from the beef. Cut the trimmed beef into large 2-3 inch chunks.
step 2:
Heat the cooking oil in a large skillet over a medium flame. When the oil is very hot, add the beef pieces and cook for a few minutes on each side or until well browned. Cook the pieces in batches to avoid over crowding the skillet.
step 3:
Place the browned beef in the slow cooker. Add the beef broth to the still warm skillet and whisk to dissolve any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. Pour the beef broth from the skillet into the slow cooker. Sprinkle the oregano, thyme, and rosemary over the beef. Top with some freshly cracked pepper (10-15 cranks of a pepper mill).
step 4:
Finally, add the tomato paste to the slow cooker along with the crushed tomatoes. Place a lid on the slow cooker and turn on the heat to high. Cook for 6-8 hours on high, or until the meat is extremely tender and shreds easily.
step 5:
Use tongs to shred the meat in the sauce, removing any remaining large pieces of fat or connective tissue that did not break down. Stir the sauce well, taste, and add salt as needed (1/2 to 1 teaspoon). Serve immediately with pasta or divide the sauce into smaller containers (for faster cooling) and refrigerate. Once completely cooled, the sauce can be frozen for longer storage.

	name: soy sauce
	amount: 1
	unit: Tbsp
	name: toasted sesame oil
	amount: 1
	unit: Tbsp
step 0:
Peel and slice the ginger, and crush the cloves of garlic. Slice the mushrooms into thin strips. Remove the skin from the chicken pieces.
step 1:
Place the uncooked rice in the bottom of the Instant Pot and add the crushed garlic, sliced ginger, and sliced mushrooms on top. Lay the chicken pieces over the rice and aromatics. Finally, add seven cups of water.
step 2:
Close and lock the lid of the Instant Pot. Turn the steam release valve to the "sealing" position. Press the "porridge" button to begin cooking (no need to adjust the time or pressure). After ten seconds the pot will begin to heat and build pressure. Once it reaches the required temperature and pressure, the display will begin to count down 20 minutes.
step 3:
After 20 minutes, the pot will switch to the "keep warm" setting and begin to drop in pressure. Allow the pot to reduce in pressure naturally, without opening the steam release valve. When the float valve falls back to the down position, open the steam valve, and then open the lid.
step 4:
Using tongs, carefully remove the chicken pieces and place them on a clean cutting board. Use two forks to shred the meat and remove the bones. Return the shredded meat to the pot.
step 5:
Stir and taste the porridge, and add salt as needed (I added 1/2 Tbsp). Only add enough salt to amplify the flavors, but leave room for the addition of soy sauce as a topping.
step 6:
Ladle the congee into each bowl and drizzle a small amount (1 tsp) of toasted sesame oil and soy sauce on top of each bowl. Sprinkle the sliced green onions, cilantro leaves, and chopped peanuts over top, then serve.

	name: cooked rice
	amount: 4
	unit: cups
step 0:
Place a few folded paper towels or a clean, lint-free dish cloth on a large plate. Remove the tofu from the package and place it on the towels. Place more towels on top, cover with a second plate, and then weigh the top plate down with a few canned goods or a pot filled with water. Press the tofu for at least 30 minutes to extract excess water (refrigerate if pressing for longer).
step 1:
While the tofu is pressing, prepare the sauce so that the flavors have time to blend. In a small bowl combine the soy sauce, water, sesame oil, brown sugar, rice vinegar, grated ginger, minced garlic, sesame seeds, and cornstarch. Stir until the brown sugar and cornstarch are dissolved, then set the sauce aside.
step 2:
Cut the pressed tofu into 1-inch cubes, then season with a pinch of salt. Sprinkle 1 Tbsp cornstarch over the cubes, then toss to coat. Repeat with the second tablespoon of cornstarch, or until the tofu cubes have a nice even coating of cornstarch.
step 3:
Heat a large skillet over medium flame. Once hot, add 2 Tbsp oil and tilt the skillet until the bottom is coated in a thick layer of oil. Add the dusted tofu cubes and let cook until golden brown on the bottom. Use a spatula to turn the cubes to an uncooked side, and cook until golden brown again. Continue this process until brown and crispy on all sides, then remove the crispy tofu to a clean plate.
step 4:
Add the frozen broccoli to the hot skillet and briefly stir fry until slightly browned on the edges. Don't worry if it's not thawed through yet, it will warm through after adding the sauce. Lower the heat to medium-low.
step 5:
Give the bowl of sauce a good stir, then pour it into the skillet with the broccoli. Stir and cook until the sauce begins to bubble and thicken (this should happen very quickly). Once thickened, turn off the heat and stir in the cooked tofu cubes.
step 6:
Serve the tofu and broccoli over a bed of cooked rice, topped with sliced green onions.

	unit: n/a
	name: bunch cilantro (or green onions), roughly chopped
	amount: 1/4
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Begin by making the sauce. In a small sauce pot, combine the chili powder, flour, and oil. Heat over a medium flame, while stirring, for one to two minutes to toast the spices and flour. Whisk in the water, tomato paste, cumin, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper. Allow the mixture to come to a simmer, at which point it will thicken. Once thick enough to coat a spoon, taste and add salt as needed (1/2 to 3/4 tsp). Set the sauce aside. (step by step photos here)
step 1:
Toast the tortillas in a dry skillet over medium flame until they are just flecked with brown on each side. The tortillas should be slightly more firm, but still pliable enough to roll. Stack the tortillas on a clean plate as they come out of the skillet.
step 2:
Prepare a casserole dish by coating with non-stick spray, then spread a layer of enchilada sauce over the bottom (1/2 to 1 cup). Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
step 3:
Add about 1/4 cup of refried beans to each tortilla, plus a small pinch of shredded cheese. Roll the tortilla tightly around the beans and cheese, then place seam side down in the casserole dish. Continue until all of the tortillas are filled. Pour another 1/2 to 1 cup enchilada sauce over the rolled enchiladas in the dish, leaving some of the edges exposed so they can become brown and crispy. Top with the remaining shredded cheese.
step 4:
Bake the casserole in the oven for 25-30 minutes or until the sauce is thick and bubbly around the edges and the center is heated through. Top with thin slices of avocado and chopped cilantro leaves (or sliced green onions).

step 0:
Prepare the sauce by stirring together the soy sauce, sriracha, and brown sugar. Drain the pineapple well. Slice the green onions. Crack the eggs into a bowl and then whisk until smooth.
step 1:
Add the unsweetened coconut shreds to a large skillet (do not add oil) and heat over a medium flame. Stir and cook the coconut continuously until it begins to turn golden brown and fragrant. Once golden brown, transfer the toasted coconut from the skillet to a clean bowl and set it aside until ready to use.

step 3:
Add another tablespoon of cooking oil to the skillet and swirl again to coat the surface. Pour in the whisked eggs and gently scramble the eggs as they cook. Cook the eggs just until they are set, yet still moist, then transfer them from the skillet to the bowl where the shrimp is being held.
step 4:
Add the drained pineapple and the lower half of the green onions (the white ends and some of the green) to the skillet. Stir and cook just until warmed through, then transfer to the bowl with the eggs and shrimp.
step 5:
Add one more tablespoon of cooking oil to the skillet, swirl to coat, then add the cold cooked rice. Let the rice cook in the skillet until you hear it begin to sizzle and crackle, then sir and let it continue to cook some more. Avoid over stirring the rice as it cooks to prevent it from becoming sticky and gummy. Continue to cook the rice until it is heated through and slightly golden.
step 6:
Finally, add the cooked shrimp, eggs, pineapple, and green onion back to the skillet. Pour the prepared sauce over top, and stir until everything is coated in sauce. Allow the mixture to heat through.
step 7:
Top the fried rice with the toasted coconut, the remaining green onion, and some fresh cilantro leaves just before serving.

Add the chopped walnuts to the skillet and stir to combine with the partially melted brown sugar. Continue to cook over medium heat, stirring every 10-15 seconds, until the brown sugar fully melts (looks glossy instead of grainy) and completely coats the walnuts. 
step 3:
Remove the skillet from the heat immediately and pour the hot candied walnuts out onto a piece of parchment. Spread the walnut pieces out in a single layer and let cool (about 10 minutes).
step 4:
Add the torn kale leaves to a large bowl. Add about 2 Tbsp of the balsamic vinaigrette and massage the dressing into the torn kale leaves for about 2 minutes. The kale will wilt to about half the volume.
step 5:
Cut the apple into four quarters, then cut the core off of each piece. Slice each quarter of the apple into thin pieces.
step 6:
Divide the massaged kale between four plates. Add apple slices, a tablespoon or two of candied walnuts, and about 1/2 Tbsp blue cheese to each salad. Drizzle a little more balsamic vinaigrette over each, then serve!

	name: fresh spinach
	amount: 4
	unit: cups
	name: hummus
	amount: 1/2
	unit: cup
step 0:
Make the dressing first. In a small bowl combine the garlic powder, onion powder, dill, parsley, salt, pepper, tahini, water, and lemon juice. Stir or whisk until smooth. Refrigerate the dressing as you prepare the rest of the salad.
step 1:
Begin cooking the quinoa. Rinse the quinoa well in a fine wire mesh sieve. Place the rinsed quinoa in a small sauce pot and add 1.75 cups water. Place a lid on top, turn the heat on to high, and bring it up to a boil. Once it reaches a boil, turn the heat down to low and let it simmer for 15 minutes.
step 2:
After letting the quinoa simmer for 15 minutes, turn the heat off and let it rest with the lid in place for five minutes. Empty the cooked quinoa out into a casserole dish, spreading it out to increase the surface area. Refrigerate the dish with the quinoa until you're ready to assemble the meal preps.
step 3:
Preheat the oven to 400ºF. Place the grape tomatoes onto a large baking sheet. Slice the onion into 1/4-inch strips. Cut the zucchini and yellow squash into 1/4-inch wide half-rounds. Cut the mushrooms in half. Mix the vegetables together on the baking sheet. If there are too many to fit in a single layer on the baking sheet, divide them between two baking sheets.
step 4:
Add the olive oil, oregano, garlic powder, and salt to the vegetables. Use your hands to mix the vegetables and seasoning, until the vegetables are well coated in oil.
step 5:
Roast the vegetables in the preheated 400ºF oven, stirring every 15 minutes, until the vegetables are browned on the edges. Allow the vegetables to cool for about 10 minutes at room temperature.
step 6:
To build the meal prep bowls, place one heaping cup of spinach in each dish. Add 1/2 cup of the cooked and cooled quinoa on top of the spinach. Divide the roasted vegetables between the four containers, then add 2 Tbsp hummus to each dish.
step 7:
Divide the dressing between four small dressing containers. Refrigerate the salads and dressing for up to 4 days.

step 0:
Dice the onion, mince the garlic, and grate the ginger. Add the onion, garlic, and ginger to a large soup pot with the olive oil and sauté over medium heat until the onions are soft and translucent.
step 1:
While the onion, garlic, and ginger are sautéing, peel and chop the carrots, and chop the celery.

step 0:
Peel and grate the ginger using a small holed cheese grater. Mince the garlic, and dice the onion. Sauté the onion, ginger, and garlic in a large pot with the olive oil over medium heat for 2-3 minutes, or until the onion becomes soft and translucent.
step 1:
While the onion, ginger, and garlic are sautéing, peel and dice the sweet potato into 1/2-inch cubes. Add the sweet potato cubes, cumin, and red pepper to the pot and continue to sauté for about 5 minutes.
step 2:
Add the tomato paste, peanut butter, and vegetable broth to the pot. Stir until the peanut butter and tomato paste have mostly dissolved into the broth. Place a lid on the pot and turn the heat up to high. Allow the stew to come up to a boil. Once it reaches a boil, turn the heat down to medium-low and allow it to simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the sweet potatoes are very soft.
step 3:
While the soup is simmering, prepare the collard greens. Use a sharp knife to remove each stem (cut along the side of each stem), then stack the leaves and cut them into 1/2-inch wide strips. Place the chopped collard greens in a colander and rinse very well
step 4:
Once the stew has simmered for 15-20 minutes and the sweet potatoes are very soft, stir in the collard greens. Let the stew simmer for about 5 minutes more, then begin to smash the sweet potatoes against the side of the pot to help thicken the stew.
step 5:
Finally, taste the stew and add salt or red pepper, if desired. Serve the stew with a scoop of cooked rice (about 3/4 cup), a few chopped peanuts, fresh cilantro, and a drizzle of sriracha, if desired.

	amount: 1/2
	unit: Tbsp
	name: jam (raspberry or your favorite flavor)
	amount: 1/4
	unit: cup
step 0:
Prepare the batter first, so it has some time to come up to room temperature. In a blender, combine the eggs, milk, flour, sugar, salt, almond extract and vanilla extract. Blend until completely smooth and no lumps remain. Let the batter sit at room temperature to warm.
step 1:
Place a 10-inch cast iron skillet in the oven and begin preheating to 425ºF. Let the skillet heat in the oven for an additional 10 minutes once the oven reaches the set temperature.
step 2:
Carefully remove the skillet from the oven and add the butter. Swirl the butter in the skillet and place it back in the oven for one minute. After one minute the butter should be beginning to brown. 
step 3:
Carefully remove the skillet from the oven again and spread the butter evenly across the bottom and up the sides of the skillet (I used a silicone brush for this). Pour the prepared batter into the hot skillet and sprinkle the sliced almonds over top.
step 4:
Return the hot skillet to the hot oven and bake for 20 minutes, or until it is golden brown and has puffed along the edges and in the center.
step 5:
While the Dutch baby is in the oven, combine the remaining 1/2 Tbsp of sugar with the ricotta. Once the Dutch baby has finished baking, either add a dollop of the sweetened ricotta to the whole pancake and top with jam for presentation, or slice the pancake into four pieces and add 2 Tbsp sweetened ricotta and 1 Tbsp jam to each piece.

	unit: tsp
	name: salt
	amount: 1/4
	unit: tsp
step 0:
The day before, prepare the strata so it can refrigerate over night. Preheat the oven to 300ºF. Tear the bread into 1/2 to 1-inch chunks and spread them out over a large baking sheet. Bake the bread chunks in the oven for 20 minutes, stirring once half-way through, to partially dry the bread.
step 1:
Meanwhile, slice the mushrooms, then add them to a large skillet with the butter, minced garlic, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Sauté the mushrooms over medium heat until they release all their moisture and begin to brown (about 5-7 minutes). 
step 2:
Remove the cooked mushrooms from the skillet and add the kale in its place along with a couple tablespoons of water (this helps the kale wilt). Sauté the kale until wilted (2-3 minutes).
step 3:
Coat the inside of a 3 quart casserole dish with butter or non-stick spray. Layer half of the dry bread chunks in the bottom of the dish, then top with half of the mushrooms, half of the kale, and half of the Swiss. Wiggle the ingredients down between the bread chunks a bit, then repeat all the layers a second time.
step 4:
In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, Dijon, nutmeg, and 1/4 tsp salt. Pour the egg mixture over the prepared strata, making sure to drizzle over every surface of the strata, rather than just pouring in one spot. Cover the strata and refrigerate for 8-24 hours.
step 5:
The next day, allow the strata to sit at room temperature for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350ºF. Bake the casserole for 50 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 160ºF and the top is deeply golden brown.
step 6:
Let the strata rest for 10 minutes, then slice into six pieces and serve!

	unit: cup
	name: feta
	amount: 2
	unit: oz.
step 0:
Remove the husks and silk from the corn cobs, and cut the stems off. Brush the surface of the corn with oil.
step 1:
Heat a cast iron skillet or gill pan over medium heat for at least five minutes, giving it plenty of time to build up a lot of heat. Once very hot, add the corn cobs. Allow the corn to cook, turning occasionally, until the kernels have become bright in color and some have developed deep char marks. This should take about 15 minutes total.
step 2:
While the corn is cooking, slice the zucchini in half lengthwise and the red onion into thick rings. Brush all sides of the zucchini and onion with oil.
step 3:
When the corn is finished cooking, remove it to a cutting board to cool slightly, and add the zucchini in its place. Cook the zucchini on each side until well charred (about 10 minutes total), then remove to the cutting board. Lastly, cook the onion slices until charred on each side (about 5 minutes total). 
step 4:
Slice or chop the zucchini into half-rounds or quarter-rounds. Chop the onion into small pieces. Roughly chop about 1/4 cup of cilantro. Place the zucchini, onion, and cilantro in a large bow. 
step 5:
Stand the corn cobs on end and use a sharp knife to carefully slice down each side to remove the kernels. Place the kernels in the bowl with the zucchini, onion, and cilantro.
step 6:
Season the vegetables with a couple generous pinches of salt and pepper, then toss to combine. Finally, crumble the feta over top and gently toss one more time to combine. Serve immediately or refrigerate for later. This salad can be served slightly warm or cold.

step 0:
Preheat the oven to 425ºF. Cook the brown rice according to the package directions. (Add rice, salt, and water to a pot, cover, bring to a boil over high heat, then turn the heat down to low and simmer for 35 minutes.)
step 1:
While the rice is cooking, begin the chicken. Add the chicken breasts to a medium sauce pot along with the salsa, chicken broth, and chili powder. Give everything a brief stir.
step 2:
Place a lid on the pot and bring it to a boil over high heat. Once the liquid starts boiling, turn the heat down to low and let the chicken simmer over low for 30 minutes. Make sure it's simmering the whole time, adjusting the heat slightly if needed.
step 3:
While the rice and chicken are cooking, prepare the bell peppers. Slice the bell peppers into 1/2-wide strips. Place them on a baking sheet and drizzle with cooking oil. Toss the peppers to coat them in oil, then sprinkle with a pinch of salt. 
step 4:
Roast the peppers in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until they are browned on the edges, stirring once half way through.
step 5:
After the chicken has simmered for 30 minutes, remove it from the salsa mixture and use two forks to shred the meat. Return the shredded chicken to the pot of salsa and stir to combine.
step 6:
Once the rice has rested, the chicken has been shredded, and the peppers have finished roasting, it's time to build the bowls.
step 7:
Add about 3/4 cup rice to each container, followed by 1/4 of the roasted peppers, and 1/4 of the shredded chicken. Spoon the salsa mixture from the pot over the shredded chicken in the containers. This will act as a sauce to help moisten the entire dish. Top with sliced green onions and a dollop of sour cream and serve immediately or refrigerate for up to 4 days.

Preheat the oven to 400ºF. To make the Chipotle Lime crema, zest and juice the lime. Combine the sour cream with 1 Tbsp lime juice, about 1/2 tsp lime zest, the chipotle powder, garlic powder, and 1/4 tsp salt. Stir the ingredients together, then refrigerate until ready to use.
step 1:
Wash then dry the sweet potatoes. Use a fork to prick the skins several times all over. Slice the sweet potatoes in half lengthwise, then use 1 Tbsp olive oil to coat the surface of all four pieces.
step 2:
Season the cut sides of the sweet potatoes with Jerk Seasoning, or whatever seasoning salt you prefer. Coat the surface of a baking sheet with a thin layer of oil, then place the sweet potatoes cut side down. Bake the sweet potatoes for 30 minutes, or until they are soft, you can see the juices oozing out from underneath, and the skins look a little wrinkly.

While the sweet potatoes are baking, Mince a clove of garlic, dice the red bell pepper, slice the jalapeño and green onion.
step 4:
Add the minced garlic to a skillet with the remaining 1 Tbsp olive oil. Sauté over medium heat for one minute, then add the diced bell pepper. Sauté the pepper for 2-3 minutes, or just until it begins to soften, then add the black beans, cumin, salt, and green onion. Stir and cook until the beans are heated through. 
step 5:
When the sweet potatoes come out of the oven, use a spatula to flip them over. Mash the flesh of the sweet potatoes with a fork, then pile the bean and pepper mixture over top. Add the sliced jalapeño and a dollop (or drizzle) of the chipotle lime crema to each, then serve.

	unit: cups
step 0:
Preheat the oven to 400ºF. Zest the lemon, then squeeze the juice. Combine the olive oil, lemon juice (about 1/4 cup), garlic, oregano, salt, and some freshly cracked pepper in a bowl. Save the lemon zest for later.
step 1:
Chop the bell peppers and onions into 1 to 1.5-inch pieces. Place the tomatoes, bell peppers, and onions on a large baking sheet. Pour about half of the lemon garlic marinade over the vegetables and toss until they are well coated. Roast the vegetables in the preheated oven for about 10 minutes as you prepare the chicken.
step 2:
While the vegetables begin roasting, prepare the chicken breasts. If your chicken breasts are thicker than 3/4-inch, pound them out to an even thickness of 1/2 to 3/4-inch thick. This will help them cook quickly and evenly. To pound the chicken, place them on a cutting board, cover with plastic wrap to prevent splatter, then gently pound the thicker ends with a rolling pin or mallet until even with the thinner end.
step 3:
Cut each chicken breast into two pieces. Place the chicken in a shallow dish and pour the remaining marinade over top. Toss the chicken in the marinade to coat.
step 4:
After roasting for ten minutes, remove the baking sheet with the vegetables from the oven. Stir the vegetables well, then push them off to each side making room for the chicken in the center. Place the chicken pieces on the baking sheet.
step 5:
Return the baking sheet to the oven and bake the chicken and vegetables for an additional 20-25 minutes, or until the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 165ºF. For additional browning, switch the oven to broil and finish by broiling the chicken and vegetables for about 5 minutes. 
step 6:
Slice the olives in half. Sprinkle the olives, feta, lemon zest, and parsley over the chicken and vegetables after roasting, then serve (with rice, if desired).

	amount: 1/2
	unit: 12 oz. jar
	name: grape tomatoes
	amount: 1
	unit: pint
step 0:
Make the vinaigrette first so the flavors have time to blend. Add the olive oil, red wine vinegar, lemon juice, Italian seasoning blend, garlic powder, salt, Dijon, and sugar in a bowl or jar. Whisk the ingredients together or close the jar and shake until combined. Set the dressing aside.
step 1:
Cook the orzo according to the package directions (boil until tender). Drain the orzo in a colander and rinse briefly with cool water. Allow the orzo to cool and drain as you prepare the rest of the ingredients. You want the pasta to be as cool and dry as possible.
step 2:
Rinse and drain the can of chickpeas, again allowing them to drain very well as you prepare the rest of the ingredients.
step 3:
Roughly chop the spinach and place it in a large bowl. Remove the roasted red peppers, olives, and artichoke hearts from their brines. Slice the olives and roasted red peppers, and roughly chop the artichoke hearts. Slice the grape tomatoes in half. Place the chopped vegetables in the bowl with the spinach.
step 4:
Finally, add the drained orzo and chickpeas to the bowl with the other ingredients. Stir the vinaigrette once more, then add half to the bowl. Toss the salad ingredients together until coated, and add more dressing if desired (I used the entire batch, but it's always best to start with half and add more as needed).

	name: ground nutmeg
	amount: 1/4
	unit: tsp
	name: butter, frozen (1 stick)
	amount: 8
	unit: Tbsp
	name: whole milk
	amount: 1
	unit: cup
step 0:
Use a fork to prick the skin of the sweet potato several times. Place the sweet potato on a microwave safe plate, then microwave on high for 5 minutes. After five minutes, use the fork to pierce the sweet potato in the thickest part. If it's not very soft all the way through, microwave for an additional 1-2 minutes, or until the center is very soft.
step 1:
Carefully remove the sweet potato from the microwave (the plate will be VERY hot). Use a towel to grasp the sweet potato as you cut open the skin and scoop out the flesh. Scoop out one packed cup of sweet potato and place it in a medium bowl. Use the fork to mash the sweet potato until smooth. Set it aside to cool further.
step 2:
Preheat the oven to 400ºF. In a separate large bowl, combine 2 cups of the all-purpose flour (reserving the last 1/4 cup for later), baking powder, sugar, salt, and nutmeg. Stir until these ingredients are very well combined.
step 3:
Use a cheese grater to grate the frozen butter into the bowl with the flour mixture. Take care to guard your fingers and knuckles when you get down to the end of the stick of butter. Stir the grated butter into the flour mixture until they are evenly combined.
step 4:
Add the milk to the bowl with the mashed sweet potato. Stir or whisk the sweet potato and milk together until they are well combined. A few small chunks of sweet potato are okay.
step 5:
Finally, pour the sweet potato and milk mixture into the bowl of flour and butter. Stir to combine the wet and dry ingredients until one cohesive ball of dough forms. Because sweet potatoes can vary in moisture content, you may need to add extra flour or milk to the dough to get the right consistency. The biscuit dough should be slightly sticky, but not so wet that it is glossy, and no dry flour should remain on the bottom of the bowl. If the dough is too dry (not forming a single ball of dough) add a couple tablespoons of milk. If it's too wet, dust it liberally with the reserved flour.
step 6:
Turn the dough out onto a well floured surface. Press it down into a flat circle, about 1-inch thick. Use a biscuit cutter or a drinking glass to cut biscuits from the dough. Gather up the dough scraps, reshape them into a 1-inch thick circle, and cut more biscuits. Repeat this until no more dough remains. Place the cut biscuits on a parchment lined baking sheet.
step 7:
Bake the biscuits for about 20 minutes, or until they are golden brown on top. Serve warm, with butter or maple syrup.

Once the single kernel pops, lift the lid on the pot, add the rest of the popcorn kernels, and replace the lid. Give the pot a vigorous shake back and forth to make sure all the kernels are coated in the hot oil. Let the pot continue to heat over medium-high, shaking the pot occasionally, until all the kernels are popped (or until you hear the popping slow to one kernel every 3 seconds or so).
step 2:
Remove the pot from the heat and immediately pour the popped corn into a large bowl. Let the pot sit for a couple of minutes to cool slightly so the butter doesn't burn. Once slightly cooled, add the butter and sriracha to the pot. Allow the butter to melt then swirl it with the sriracha to combine.
step 3:
Drizzle the sriracha butter over the popcorn in the bowl, then pour the popcorn back into the pot. Place the lid on top and give the popcorn a really good shake until all the kernels are evenly coated in sriracha butter. Return the coated popcorn to the bowl, sprinkle the nutritional yeast over top, then serve. Add salt if desired (I did not).

step 0:
Dice the onion and mince the garlic. Cook in a medium pot over medium heat with olive oil until the onion is transparent (about two minutes).
step 1:
Add the can of tomatoes, the chicken base and water. Stir to combine. Season with freshly cracked black pepper, brown sugar and red pepper flakes. If you’d like to add other herbs (fresh basil, bay leaf, oregano), do so at this time.
step 2:
Stir in the bread crumbs. Allow the soup to simmer over medium heat for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Taste and adjust salt and pepper to your liking.
step 3:
At this point, you can either serve the soup as is (slightly chunky) or puree with an immersion blender. If you decide to puree in a regular blender, be very very careful. Blending hot liquids can be dangerous. The soup pictured here has not been blended at all and, as you can see, is still fairly smooth.

step 0:
Before cooking the lentils, sort through them to remove any stones or debris. Bring a large sauce pot to a boil over high heat, then add the lentils. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and let simmer for 20 minutes*. Test the lentils to make sure they are tender and then drain in a colander. Set the cooked lentils aside until you are ready to add them to the sloppy joes. The lentils can be simmering while you make the rest of the sloppy joes.
step 1:
Mince the garlic and finely dice the onion. Add both to a large skillet along with the olive oil and sauté over medium heat until they begin to soften (3-5 minutes).
step 2:
While the onion and garlic are cooking, finely dice the bell pepper. Add the diced bell pepper to the skillet and sauté a few minutes more.
step 3:
Add the ground beef and continue to cook until the beef is fully browned (about 5-7 minutes).
step 4:
Add the tomato sauce, tomato paste, cider vinegar, brown sugar, dijon, chili powder, and salt. Stir well and let simmer for 5-10 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened to your liking.
step 5:
Stir in the cooked lentils and heat through. Taste and adjust the salt, if needed. Serve warm on a bun!

	amount: 1
	unit: 15 oz. can
	name: feta
	amount: 2
	unit: oz.
step 0:
While your quinoa (or other grain) is cooking, prepare the vinaigrette so it has a few minutes for the flavors to blend. In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, red wine vinegar, lemon juice, oregano, garlic powder, salt, and some freshly cracked pepper. Set the dressing aside.
step 1:
Roughly chop the spinach into smaller pieces, then place them in a large bowl. Slice the tomatoes in half, then add them to the bowl with the spinach. Rinse and drain the chickpeas, then add them to the bowl. Lastly, crumble the feta over top. Give these ingredients a brief stir until they're combined.
step 2:
Allow your quinoa or grains to cool slightly, or just to the point where it's no longer steaming. Add the warm quinoa to the salad and stir to combine. The heat from the quinoa will slightly wilt the spinach. 
step 3:
Finally, drizzle the dressing over top and stir briefly once more. Serve the salad immediately, or refrigerate up to 4-5 days.

	name: jumbo pasta shells (about 22-25 shells)
	amount: 8
	unit: oz.
	name: pasta sauce 
	amount: 24
	unit: oz.
step 0:
Make sure the spinach is completely thawed, then squeeze out as much of the moisture as possible. Add the spinach to a large bowl with the ricotta, mozzarella, pesto, and egg. Stir until the ingredients are well combined, then refrigerate until it's ready to be used.
step 1:
Bring a large pot of water to a boil, then add the jumbo shells. Cook the shells just until they're tender, making sure not to over cook the pasta. The longer the shells boil, the more likely they are to tear during the stuffing process. Drain the shells in a colander and then rinse briefly with cool water to make them cool enough to handle.
step 2:
Preheat the oven to 350ºF. Spread about 1 cup of pasta sauce in the bottom of a large casserole dish.
step 3:
One by one, stuff each shell with a couple tablespoons of the cheese, pesto, and spinach mixture. Place the shells in the casserole dish as you stuff them.
step 4:
Once the shells are all stuffed, pour the remaining two cups of pasta sauce over top. Bake the shells for about 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the sauce is bubbling up around the edges. Serve hot.

	amount: 1/4 
	unit: bunch
step 0:
In a small bowl, combine the garam masala, cumin, turmeric, smoked paprika, salt, cayenne, and some freshly cracked pepper (about 10 cranks of a pepper mill). Sprinkle the spice mix over both sides of the chicken thighs, coating them liberally.
step 1:
Heat the cooking oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the seasoned chicken and cook for about 3 minutes on each side, or until well browned (the chicken does not need to be cooked through). Transfer the seared chicken to the slow cooker.
step 2:
Add the diced onion to the skillet and continue to cook until the onions are soft and slightly browned on the edges. Remove the skillet from the heat. Add the onions to the slow cooker, then add 1/4 cup of water to the skillet and stir to dissolve the browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. Pour the water into the slow cooker.
step 3:
Add the minced garlic, grated ginger, and tomato sauce to the slow cooker with the chicken and onion. Briefly stir, then place the lid on top, and turn the slow cooker on. Cook on high for 3 hours or low for 6 hours.
step 4:
After 3 hours on high or 6 hours on low, the chicken should be fall-apart tender. Turn the slow cooker off, then add the heavy cream. Stir gently to combine the cream with the tomato sauce. Taste the sauce and add salt if needed.
step 5:
To serve, spoon the chicken and tomato sauce over cooked rice and top with fresh cilantro.

	name: shredded mozzarella
	amount: 2 
	unit: cups 
	name: chopped parsley (optional, for garnish)
	amount: 1
	unit: handful
step 0:
Brown the sausage in a large skillet or pot over medium heat, until it's brown and crispy on the edges (pork sausage contains a lot of fat, so I didn't add any extra to the skillet).
step 1:
While the sausage is browning, finely dice the onion. Add the onion to the skillet once the sausage has browned, and continue to sauté over medium heat until the onion is soft and translucent.
step 2:
Add the tomato paste, crushed tomatoes, Italian seasoning, and 1/2 cup water to the skillet with the sausage and stir to combine. Place a lid on the skillet and allow it to come up to a simmer. Once simmering, turn the heat down and allow it to continue to simmer while you cook the ziti. Stir the sauce occasionally as it simmers.
step 3:
After getting the sauce started, begin the ziti. Bring a large pot of water with 1/2 Tbsp salt to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, add the ziti, and let it continue to boil until the ziti is tender (about 7-8 minutes). Drain the ziti in a colander. Shake the colander a bit to shake excess water out of the pasta.
step 4:
While the pasta and sauce are cooking, prepare the cheese filling. Add the ricotta, Italian cheese blend, and some freshly cracked black pepper (about 10 cranks of a pepper mill) to a bowl and stir to combine. Begin to preheat the oven to 350ºF.
step 5:
After draining the ziti, return it to the pot and add 1 cup of the red sauce. Stir to coat the cooked pasta in sauce.
step 6:
Pour half of the ziti to a 9x13" baking dish. Add half of the ricotta mixture on top of the ziti in small dollops. Finally, spoon half of the red sauce and sausage over the pasta and ricotta. It's okay if the ingredients don't cover in a solid layer. Repeat these layers with the second half of the pasta, ricotta mixture, and sauce. Finally, top with 2 cups shredded mozzarella.
step 7:
Cover the baking dish with foil, making sure it's slightly tented so that it doesn't touch or stick to the melted cheese. Transfer the covered casserole to the oven and bake for 20 minutes. 
step 8:
After baking for 20 minutes, remove the foil, and turn the oven on to broil (keep the casserole on the middle rack, about 10-12 inches from the broiler). Broil for 5 minutes, or just until the cheese is slightly browned. Keep a close eye on the baked ziti as it broils, because broilers can vary in intensity. Top with chopped parsley, if desired, then serve.

	unit: cups 
	name: mayonnaise*
	amount: 2
	unit: Tbsp
	name: sriracha*
	amount: 1
	unit: Tbsp
step 0:
Cut the eggplant into 3/4-inch cubes. The easiest way to do this is to first slice the eggplant into 3/4-inch slices, then lay each slice flat and slice into 3/4-inch squares.
step 1:
Add the olive oil to a large skillet at head over medium. Once hot, swirl the oil to coat the surface of the skillet, then add the eggplant cubes. Cook the eggplant cubes, stirring occasionally, until they are softened (about ten minutes). If the eggplant begins to stick, add a couple tablespoons of water to the skillet to help loosen the eggplant.
step 2:
While the eggplant is cooking, prepare the soy ginger glaze. Stir together the soy sauce, brown sugar, minced garlic, and ginger in a bowl.
step 3:
Once the eggplant is soft, pour in the soy ginger glaze, making sure to scrape out all the sugar that may have settled to the bottom of the bowl. Continue to stir and cook the eggplant in the skillet, dissolving any browned bits off the bottom, for about 5 more minutes.
step 4:
Top the eggplant with chopped peanuts and sliced green onion before serving. Serve over warm rice with a drizzle of sriracha mayo, if desired.

	amount: n/a
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Preheat the oven to 400ºF. Wash the mushrooms and cut them in half if they are large.
step 1:
In a small dish, stir together the olive oil, balsamic vinegar, brown sugar, soy sauce, minced garlic, and thyme. Place the mushrooms in a casserole dish big enough to allow them to be in a single layer. Pour the balsamic marinade over top and stir until the mushrooms are coated.
step 2:
Transfer the the mushrooms to the preheated oven and roast for 45 minutes, giving them a stir every 15 minutes. After 45 minutes the mushrooms should be tender and there should be a nice sauce in the bottom of the dish.
step 3:
Meanwhile, prepare the mashed potatoes. Peel and dice the potatoes into one-inch cubes. Rinse the cubes well in a colander, then place them in a large pot, add 1/2 tsp salt, and cover with cool water. Place a lid on the pot, bring it up to a boil. Boil the potatoes until they are very tender (about 7-10 minutes).
step 4:
Once the potatoes are very tender, drain them in the colander and rinse them briefly with hot water. Let the potatoes drain in the colander as you prepare the kale.
step 5:
To the pot used to boil the potatoes, add the chopped kale, 1 Tbsp olive oil, and 2 Tbsp water. Sauté over medium heat just until wilted (3-5 minutes), then remove the kale from the pot.
step 6:
Return the drained potatoes to the pot along with the sour cream, milk, dried parsley, oregano, basil, garlic powder, onion powder, 1/4 tsp salt, and some freshly cracked pepper. Mash the potatoes until smooth, then taste and add more salt if needed. Stir in the sautéed kale. 
step 7:
To make the bowls, add 1/4 of the herby kale mashed potatoes to each bowl, then top with 1/4 of the balsamic roasted mushrooms. Drizzle a spoonful or two of the juices from the bottom of the casserole dish over the mushrooms and mashed potatoes.

	unit: cup
	name: water
	amount: 2
	unit: cups
step 0:
Add the sugar and water to a pot large enough to hold the cranberries and raspberries. Turn the heat on medium and allow the sugar to dissolve.
step 1:
Rinse the cranberries under running water and remove any stems or bad berries. Add them to the sugar water along with the frozen raspberries. Increase the heat to high, cover with a lid, and allow the mixture to come to a boil. Once the mixture reaches a full boil, reduce the heat to a simmer (medium-low) and allow all of the cranberries to pop (you’ll hear them).
step 2:
Meanwhile, slice the jalapeño open and remove the seeds by scraping with a spoon. Set the seeds aside for later. Mince the jalapeño flesh. Add the minced jalapeño, cinnamon, and cloves to the pot. Stir and allow to simmer without a lid.
step 3:
Allow the mixture to simmer for 30-45 minutes or until it has reduced and thickened slightly (it will thicken further as it cools). Taste it occasionally to see if you want more heat. If so, add some of the jalapeño seeds to the pot. If the mixture is too sweet, add some lemon juice for tartness. If you have added all of the jalapeño seeds and still want more heat, you can add some red pepper flakes.

step 0:
Preheat the oven to 400ºF. Line a baking sheet with foil, then place two wire cooling racks over the foil. Lay the bacon across the wire racks. Sprinkle the brown sugar over the bacon and pat it into the surface lightly. Bake the bacon in the preheated oven until brown and crispy. (About 10 minutes for regular bacon or 20 minutes for thick cut bacon. Watch the bacon closely as every oven is different.)
step 1:
While bacon is cooking, prepare the chipotle mayo and sandwich toppings. In a small bowl, stir together the mayonnaise, chipotle powder, and garlic powder. Cover the mayo and refrigerate until ready to use. Slice the tomato into thick rounds. Wash and shake dry the lettuce. Slice the buns in half.
step 2:
Fry or scramble four eggs to your liking.
step 3:
When the bacon is finished, let it cool until it's no longer too hot to handle. Break each slice in half so that it better fits the sandwich. Spread a tablespoon of the chipotle mayo on each side of the bun, add a lettuce leaf or two, a slice of tomato, an egg, and one slice of bacon (broken into two short strips). Enjoy!

step 0:
Prepare the dressing first, so the flavors have time to blend. In a medium bowl, whisk together the buttermilk dressing ingredients (buttermilk, mayonnaise, lemon juice, salt, garlic powder, oregano, and about 10-15 cranks of a pepper mill). Taste the dressing and add more salt if desired. Refrigerate the dressing until ready to use.
step 1:
Drain the chickpeas in a colander and rinse with cool water. Add the olive oil to a non-stick skillet and place over a medium flame. Add the drained chickpeas along with the salt, smoked paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, cayenne, thyme, and another 10-15 cranks of a pepper mill. Sauté the chickpeas and spices for about five minutes, or until the chickpeas are slightly toasted. Remove from the heat.
step 2:
Remove the stems from the kale, then slice the kale leaves into thin strips (see step by step photos below for more detail). Rinse the kale with cool water and allow the excess water to drain away. Thinly slice the red onion.
step 3:
To build the salad, place the washed kale in a large bowl (or four serving bowls), add the spiced chickpeas, a few slices of red onion, and a light dusting of Parmesan (about 1 tsp per serving). Finally, taste the buttermilk dressing after it has had time to refrigerate and adjust the salt if needed. Drizzle the dressing over the salad and then serve.

	name: Salad Bar Vegetables*
	amount: n/a
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Line two small baking sheets with foil or parchment paper (or do one sheet at a time, preparing the second batch the second day). Open the English muffins and line them up on the baking sheets with cut sides facing up.
step 1:
Spread about 1 Tbsp pizza sauce over the surface of each muffin, then top with about 2 Tbsp shredded mozzarella.
step 2:
Chop the salad bar vegetables into very small pieces, then divide them evenly among the pizzas. Press down lightly on top of each pizza to help compact the toppings and keep them in place as they freeze. Cover the baking sheets with plastic wrap and freeze for about 8 hours, or until the pizzas are solid.
step 3:
Once the pizzas are frozen solid, carefully transfer them to a gallon sized freezer bag for long term storage (you may need two bags). For the best results, the pizzas should be cooked and eaten within 3 months.
step 4:
To bake the pizzas, take out the number you wish to bake, place them on a baking sheet, and let them partially thaw as you preheat the oven to 400ºF (about 7 minutes). Once the oven is fully preheated, bake the pizzas for about 15 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and the cheese is melted. Baking time will vary depending on your oven and the amount of toppings on the pizzas.

step 1:
Season the chicken thighs with a pinch of salt and pepper on each side.
step 2:
Heat a large skillet over medium. Once hot, add the olive oil and swirl to coat the surface. Add the chicken thighs to the skillet and cook on each side until browned and cooked through (about 8 minutes first side, 5 minute second side). Remove the chicken to a clean plate and cover to keep warm.
step 3:
While the chicken is cooking, clean the mushrooms and then slice them in half. After removing the chicken from the skillet, add the mushrooms in their place, and sauté in the remaining oil and fat until the mushrooms are slightly tender and browned on the outside (5-7 minutes).
step 4:
Turn the heat down to medium-low. Add the prepared balsamic sauce to the skillet and stir to dissolve any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. Allow the sauce to come up to a simmer. Simmer the balsamic sauce with the mushrooms, stirring occasionally, for about 5 minutes, or until the sauce has reduced by half.
step 5:
Add the butter to the skillet and stir until it is melted into the sauce. Add the chicken back to the skillet, turning it to coat in the sauce, and allow it to simmer for a few minutes more to rewarm the chicken. Serve hot and drizzle the pan sauce over the chicken and mushrooms.

step 0:
Cut the chicken breast into 1-inch pieces. Add the butter to a deep skillet and melt over medium heat. Add the chicken to the skillet and cook over medium heat until the chicken is slightly browned on the outside.
step 1:
While the chicken is cooking, mince the garlic. Add the garlic to the skillet with the chicken and continue to sauté for one minute more.

Once the broth comes to a full boil, give the pasta a quick stir, replace the lid, and turn the heat down to medium-low. Let the pasta simmer over medium-low heat for about 8 minutes, or until the pasta is tender and most of the broth has been absorbed. Stir the pasta briefly every two minutes as it simmers, replacing the lid quickly each time.
step 4:
Once the pasta is tender and most of the broth absorbed, add the milk, cream cheese (cut into chunks), and pesto. Stir and cook over medium heat until the cream cheese has fully melted into the sauce. Finally, add the grated Parmesan and stir until combined.
step 5:
If using, add the fresh spinach and sliced sun dried tomatoes. Stir until the spinach has wilted, then remove the pasta from the heat. Top the pasta with freshly cracked pepper and a pinch of crushed red pepper, then serve.

Add the sugar, egg, and lemon juice to a small sauce pot. Before placing the pot over the heat, whisk the ingredients together until smooth.
step 1:
Place the pot over medium heat and cook while whisking continuously. The mixture will become very frothy as you whisk. When the liquid becomes hot enough to cook the egg, the mixture will begin to thicken and no more liquid will separate from the foam. It will take about 5 minutes of whisking over medium heat for the mixture to thicken, but will vary depending on your cookware. The mixture should be thick enough to coat a spoon (see photos below).
step 2:
Remove the pot from the heat. Add one tablespoon of butter at a time, whisking until it has fully melted into the sauce before adding the next. As the butter is melted into the sauce, it will become less frothy and more silky in texture, and look more glossy rather than foamy.
step 3:
Once all of the butter has been whisked in, transfer the lemon curd to an air-tight container and refrigerate until completely cooled. The curd will thicken further upon cooling.

Carefully remove the baking sheet from the oven, give the vegetables a good stir, then return them to the oven and roast for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender and have browned on the edges. Don't be alarmed if the marinade blackens on the baking sheet, that part will not be scooped up with the vegetables.
step 4:
While the vegetables are roasting, finely chop a handful of fresh parsley. Transfer the roasted vegetables to a bowl or serving platter and sprinkle the chopped parsley over top just before serving.

step 0:
Prepare the vegetables for the soup and garnishes first, so they're ready to go when needed. Mince the garlic and grate the ginger using a small-holed cheese grater. Peel and dice the sweet potato into one-inch cubes. Wash the bok choy well, then chop into one-inch strips, separating the fibrous stalks from the delicate green ends. Thinly slice the red onion and roughly chop the cilantro.
step 1:
Add the cooking oil to a large soup pot along with the minced garlic, grated ginger, and Thai red curry paste. Sauté the garlic, ginger, and curry paste over medium heat for 1-2 minutes.
step 2:
Add the diced sweet potato and chopped bok choy stalks to the pot (save the leafy green ends for later) along with the chicken or vegetable broth. Bring the pot to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to low and let simmer for 5-7 minutes, or until the sweet potatoes are tender.
step 3:
While the soup is simmering, bring a small pot of water to a boil for the vermicelli. Once boiling, add the vermicelli and boil for 2-3 minutes, or just until tender. Drain the rice noodles in a colander and set aside.
step 4:
Once the sweet potatoes are tender, add the coconut milk, fish sauce, and brown sugar to the soup. Stir, taste, and adjust the fish sauce or brown sugar if needed. Finally, add the bok choy greens and let them wilt in the hot soup.
step 5:
To serve, divide the rice vermicelli among four bowls. Ladle the soup and vegetables over the noodles, then top with red onion, cilantro, a wedge or two of lime, and a drizzle of sriracha.

	amount: 1/4
	unit: cup
	name: chopped parsley
	amount: 1
	unit: cup
step 0:
Preheat the oven to 400ºF. Chop the cauliflower into florets and slice the red onion into 1/4-inch strips. Place the cauliflower florets and sliced red onion into a large bowl, along with the olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper. Toss the cauliflower and onion until they are well coated in oil.
step 1:
Spread the cauliflower and onion out onto a large baking sheet, then transfer them to the oven. Roast the vegetables for 20 minutes, give them a good stir, then roast for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the onions are caramelized and the cauliflower is browned.
step 2:
Meanwhile, prepare the quinoa. Rinse the quinoa well in a wire mesh sieve. Add the butter, garlic, turmeric, cumin, and cinnamon, to a medium sauce pot. Place the pot over medium heat. Stir and cook the spices for one minute.
step 3:
Add the drained quinoa to the pot with the butter and spices. Also add the dried cranberries and vegetable broth. Stir to combine, then place a lid on the pot, turn the heat up to medium-high, and bring it up to a boil. Once it reaches a boil, turn the heat down to low and let the pot simmer for 20 minutes, with the lid in place.
step 4:
After simmering over low for 20 minutes, the quinoa should have absorbed all of the broth. Remove the lid and fluff the quinoa. Add the sliced almonds and stir to combine. Allow the quinoa to cool slightly.
step 5:
Transfer the cooked quinoa and roasted cauliflower and red onion to a large bowl. Add the chopped parsley and stir until everything is combined. Serve immediately, or refrigerate until ready to eat (can be eaten warm or cold).

step 0:
Mince the garlic, grate the ginger, and dice the onion. Add the olive oil, garlic, and ginger to a deep skillet, Dutch oven, or soup pot. Sauté the garlic and ginger over medium heat for 1 minute, or just until the garlic becomes soft and fragrant. 
step 1:
Add the diced onion to the skillet and continue to sauté over medium until the onion is soft and translucent. Add the curry powder and continue to sauté for about one minute more to toast the spices.
step 2:
Add the dry lentils and vegetable broth to the skillet. Stir to dissolve any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. Place a lid on top, turn the heat up to medium-high, and bring the broth to a boil. Once boiling, turn the heat down to low, and let it simmer for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.
step 3:
After simmering for 20 minutes the lentils should be tender and most of the broth absorbed. Add the can of coconut milk and stir to combine. Turn the heat back up to medium and allow the skillet to come back up to a simmer. Let it simmer without a lid for an additional 10 minutes, stirring often, to thicken the mixture. 
step 4:
Once thickened, turn the heat off. Add the fresh spinach and stir gently until the spinach has wilted. Taste the mixture and adjust the salt or curry powder to your liking, if needed.
step 5:
Serve over a bowl of rice, and top with chopped cilantro if desired.

step 0:
To make the peanut lime dressing, combine all the ingredients in a bowl or blender. Whisk or blend until smooth. Set the dressing aside.
step 1:
Bring a pot of water to a boil for the whole wheat spaghetti. Break the spaghetti in half to make it easier to stir into the salad ingredients later. Once the water is boiling, add the spaghetti, and continue to boil until the pasta is tender. Drain in a colander and rinse it briefly with cold water to cool it off. Let the pasta drain well.
step 2:
Meanwhile, shred the cabbage as finely as possible using either a knife or the shredding attachment of a food processor. Shred the carrots using a large-holed cheese grater. Roughly chop the cilantro and peanuts. Slice the green onion.
step 3:
Combine the cooled and well drained pasta in a large bowl with the cabbage, carrots, cilantro, green onion, and peanuts. Toss the salad until the ingredients are evenly combined.
step 4:
Serve the salad and peanut lime dressing immediately, or divide the undressed salad between four containers (about 2 cups each) and divide the dressing between four smaller containers (about 2 Tbsp or slightly more each). Refrigerate up to 4-5 days.

Pour the stir fry sauce into the skillet. Continue to stir and cook the turkey and vegetables until everything is coated in sauce and the spinach is fully wilted (about 2 minutes more).
step 5:
Serve about 1 cup of the stir fry mixture with 1/2 cup rice and a sprinkle of chopped peanuts over top.

	amount: n/a
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Cook the orecchiette according to the package directions. Before draining the orecchiette in a colander, reserve about 1/3 cup of the starchy pasta water.
step 1:
While the orecchiette is cooking, begin preparing the rest of the recipe. Slice the chicken sausage into medallions.
step 2:
Add the olive oil and chicken sausage to a large pot and sauté over medium until the chicken sausage begins to brown (about 5 minutes).
step 3:
Add the minced garlic and butter to the pot with the sausage and continue to sauté for one more minute.
step 4:
Next, add the chopped kale and reserved pasta water. Turn the heat down to medium-low and continue to cook and stir until the kale has wilted (about 2-3 minutes). Use your spoon to dissolve any browned bits off the bottom of the pot as you stir. 
step 5:
Remove the pot from the heat and stir in the cooked and drained orecchiette. If the pasta and kale are still steaming heavily, let the contents of the pot cool for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally to release steam. You want the Parmesan to coat the pasta, but not melt.
step 6:
Once the pasta and kale is hot, but not steaming, add the grated Parmesan, crushed red pepper, salt, and about 15-20 cranks of a pepper mill. Stir to combine, then taste and add more salt if needed. Serve warm.

	amount: 1
	unit: cup
	name: chickpeas
	amount: 1
	unit: 15oz. can
step 0:
Rinse the quinoa well in a fine wire mesh sieve. Place the rinsed quinoa in a pot with 1.75 cups water. Place a lid on the pot, turn the heat on to high, and allow the water to come to a boil. Once it reaches a full boil, turn the heat down to low and let it simmer for 15 minutes (lid on). 
step 1:
While the quinoa is cooking, prepare the lemon garlic dressing. Zest the lemon, then squeeze the juice (you'll need 1/4 to 1/3 cup juice). Add the lemon juice and 1 tsp of the zest to a bowl or jar along with the olive oil, minced garlic, salt, and some freshly cracked pepper (10-15 cranks of a pepper mill). Whisk the ingredients together or close the jar and shake until they are combined. Set the dressing aside.
step 2:
After the quinoa has cooked, spread it out into a casserole dish or other wide shallow dish and refrigerate uncovered for about 15 minutes to cool it down.
step 3:
While the quinoa is cooling, prepare the rest of the salad ingredients. Drain the artichoke hearts and roughly chop them into smaller pieces. Finely dice the red bell pepper. Roughly chop the parsley. Rinse and drain the chickpeas. Place the artichoke hearts, bell pepper, parsley, and chickpeas in a large bowl.
step 4:
Once the quinoa has cooled, add it to the bowl with the other salad ingredients. Toss gently to combine, then drizzle the lemon garlic dressing over top. Gently toss again until everything is coated in dressing. Serve immediately or refrigerate up to 4-5 days.

step 0:
Roughly Chop the spinach. Heat a large skillet over medium, then add 1 Tbsp olive oil. Add the chopped spinach and a pinch of salt. Sauté the spinach until it has fully wilted, then remove it from the heat.
step 1:
While the spinach is sautéing, stir together the breadcrumbs, garlic powder, freshly cracked pepper (5 or 6 cranks of a pepper mill), and salt in a large bowl. Lightly whisk the egg, then add the egg, ground turkey, sautéed spinach, and crumbled feta to the bowl with the breadcrumbs. Use your hands to combine these ingredients until evenly mixed.
step 2:
Shape the meat mixture into balls, about one heaping tablespoon each. You should get approximately 24 meatballs.
step 3:
Wipe out the skillet used for the spinach, add another tablespoon of oil, and heat the skillet once again over medium. Once hot, swirl the oil in the skillet to make sure the surface is coated, then add half of the meatballs. Cook the meatballs for about a minute to a minute and a half on each side, or until the meatballs are well browned and cooked through (about 6-8 minutes total). Remove the cooked meatballs to a clean bowl and repeat with the second batch.
step 4:
Serve your cooked meatballs with your favorite sauce, over pasta, rice, or roasted vegetables.

	name: feta 
	amount: 2
	unit: oz.
step 0:
Use a zester, microplane, or small-holed cheese grater to remove the zest from the lemon. Set the zest aside. Squeeze the juice from the lemon into a separate bowl. You'll need at least 1/4 cup juice.
step 1:
Prepare the dressing and marinade by mincing two of the three cloves of garlic and combining them with 1/4 cup lemon juice, olive oil, oregano, salt, some freshly cracked pepper, and a pinch of the lemon zest. Whisk these ingredients until well combined.
step 2:
Place the chicken thighs in a small zip lock bag and add half of the dressing, saving the rest to add to the salad later. Mince one more clove of garlic and add it to the bag with the chicken and marinade. Squeeze the air out and massage the bag to make sure the thighs are well coated in the marinade. Refrigerate the thighs for at least 30 minutes.
step 3:
While the chicken is marinating, cook the pasta according to the package directions, drain in a colander, and let cool.
step 4:
Heat a skillet over a medium flame. Once hot, add the marinated chicken thighs and cook on each side until they are well browned and cooked through (about 5 minutes each side). There should be enough oil in the marinade to keep the meat from sticking. Remove the cooked chicken from the skillet and let it rest for about five minutes. Once slightly cooled, chop the chicken into smaller, bite-sized pieces.
step 5:
While the chicken is cooking, prepare the rest of the vegetables. Dice the cucumber and bell pepper. Slice the tomatoes in half (or dice if using Roma or regular tomatoes). Pull the parsley leaves from the stems and give them a rough chop.
step 6:
Finally, build the salad. Add the cooked and cooled pasta to a large bowl. Top the pasta with the cucumber, bell pepper, tomatoes, parsley, and chopped chicken. Crumble the feta over top and add a pinch or two of the lemon zest. Pour the remaining dressing over the salad and toss to coat. Serve immediately or refrigerate until ready to eat.

	name: sour cream
	amount: 1/4
	unit: cup
step 0:
In a small bowl, combine the ingredients for the taco seasoning, then set the seasoning aside (or use one envelope of store-bought taco seasoning). Preheat the oven to 400ºF.
step 1:
Dice the onion and mince the garlic. Add the onion, garlic, and cooking oil to a large skillet. Sauté the onion and garlic over medium heat until the onion is soft and translucent (about 5 minutes). Add the ground beef and prepared taco seasoning and continue to sauté until the beef is cooked through (another 5 minutes). 
step 2:
Arrange the taco shells in a casserole dish so they are all standing upright. If you do not have a dish that fits them snuggly enough to hold them up, use balled up aluminum foil to act as "book ends" to help hold the line of tacos upright.
step 3:
Drain the can of black beans well, but do not rinse them. A little sauciness helps keep the beef mixture moist.Stir the beans into the seasoned beef and allow them to heat through.
step 4:
Fill the tacos with the beef and bean mixture. Sprinkle the shredded cheese over top. Bake the tacos in the preheated oven for 7-10 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and the taco shells are golden brown on the edges.
step 5:
While the tacos are baking, dice the tomato, slice the jalapeño, and roughly chop the cilantro leaves. Sprinkle the diced tomato, jalapeño, and cilantro over the tacos, and add a dollop of sour cream just before serving.

As soon as the skillet comes to a boil, turn the heat down to low and let it simmer for 15 minutes. Make sure it is simmering the entire time, turning the heat up slightly if needed (you should be able to hear it simmer quietly).
step 2:
After 15 minutes, turn off the heat, and let it rest with the lid in place for 5 more minutes. Finally, remove the lid, and fluff the mixture with a fork. All of the liquid should be absorbed and the rice should be tender. Sprinkle 1 cup of shredded cheese over top, replace the lid, and let it sit for a few minutes, or until the cheese is melted. Meanwhile, slice the green onions. Sprinkle the green onions over the melted cheese and serve hot.

	amount: 1
	unit: tsp
	name: sugar

	unit: Tbsp
	name: baking powder
	amount: 4
	unit: tsp
	name: heavy whipping cream
	amount: 1
	unit: pint
step 0:
In a large bowl, stir together the flour, salt, sugar, and baking powder until well combined.
step 1:
Pour in the heavy cream and stir until a sticky ball of dough forms. Sprinkle the dough generously with flour and then turn the dough out onto a floured surface. Gently knead the dough 2-3 times, or just until the dough feels mixed and has enough flour that it is no longer sticky. Avoid over working the dough.
step 2:
Gently pat the dough down into a 6x8 rectangle, then fold it in half. Repeat this two more times. Folding the dough in this manner helps create layers within the biscuits.
step 3:
After folding, pat the dough down into a 6x8 rectangle one final time. The dough should be about one inch thick. Cut the dough into 12 squares.
step 4:
Line a baking sheet with parchment, then place the cut biscuits on the parchment, separated just slightly. Cover with plastic wrap and freeze the biscuits for a couple of hours, or just until solid. Label and date a gallon-sized freezer bag. Place the frozen biscuits in the bag for long term storage (3-4 months).
step 5:
To bake the biscuits, place any number of biscuits you want on a baking sheet lined with parchment. Let the biscuits thaw only as long as it takes to preheat the oven to 400ºF. Once the oven is preheated, bake the biscuits until puffed up tall and deep golden brown on top. Depending on your oven and size of the biscuits, it should take about 18-22 minutes (frozen), or 16-20 minutes (fresh).

	amount: 6
	unit: n/a
	name: Salt and pepper
	amount: Pinch

	name: jalapeño (optional), sliced thinly
	amount: 1
	unit: n/a
	name: green onions, sliced
	amount: 2
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Heat a large skillet over medium. Once hot add the cooking oil and swirl to coat the surface. While waiting for the skillet to heat, season both sides of the chicken thighs with a pinch of salt and pepper.
step 1:
Once the skillet is hot and the oil is shimmering, add the chicken thighs and cook until golden brown on each side and cooked through. Remove the cooked chicken to a clean plate.
step 2:
While the chicken is cooking, drain and reserve the juice from the canned pineapple slices.
step 3:
After removing the chicken from the skillet, turn the heat down to low and add about 1/2 cup of the reserved pineapple juice. Stir to dissolve and loosen the browned chicken bits from the bottom of the skillet. Once everything has been loosened from the skillet, add the BBQ sauce and stir until a thick sauce forms. Taste the sauce and add salt if needed. If your sauce gets too thick, simply add another splash of the reserved pineapple juice.
step 4:
Add the cooked chicken thighs and pineapple slices to the skillet, dredging both sides in the pineapple BBQ sauce.  Spoon any excess sauce over the chicken.
step 5:
Adjust your oven's rack so that the skillet will be about 6 inches from the broiler unit and turn the broiler on to high. Transfer the skillet to the oven and broil for about 5 minutes, or just until the BBQ sauce caramelizes on the edges of the chicken and pineapple. If you don't have an oven safe skillet** you can transfer the chicken, pineapple, and ALL of the sauce to a casserole dish for broiling, or skip the broiling step and enjoy as is.
step 6:
After broiling, sprinkle the sliced jalapeño and green onion over top, and then serve.

ingredients:
	name: Israeli couscous 
	amount: 1 1/2 to 2
	unit: cups
	name: medium cucumbers 
	amount: 2
	unit: n/a
	name: bunch parsley 
	amount: 1/4
	unit: n/a
	name: medium lemon 
	amount: 1

	name: freshly cracked pepper to taste 
	amount: n/a
	unit: n/a
	name: crumbled feta cheese 
	amount: 3
	unit: oz.
step 0:
Bring a medium pot of water to a rolling boil. Add the couscous and continue to let it boil for 5-7 minutes, or until the couscous is tender. Drain the couscous in a colander or wire mesh sieve (if the holes in the colander are too big). Rinse briefly with cool water to cool off the couscous, then allow to drain while you prepare the rest of the salad.
step 1:
Cut the cucumber into quarter rounds and place them in a large bowl. Take a big handful (or about 1/4 bunch) of parsley and pull the leaves from the stems. Roughly chop the parsley and then add it to the bowl with the cucumber. Use a fine holed cheese grater or a zester to remove the thin layer of yellow zest from the lemon and add it the bowl with the other ingredients.
step 2:
Cut the lemon in half and squeeze the juice into a small bowl (you should get 2-3 tablespoons of juice). Add the olive oil, garlic powder, salt, and some freshly cracked pepper. Stir to combine and then pour the dressing over the cucumber, parsley, and lemon zest. Stir to combine.
step 3:
Add the cooled and drained couscous and crumbled feta to the bowl. Gently stir to combine all of the ingredients. Taste and adjust the salt and pepper as needed. Serve immediately or chill until ready to eat.

	unit: n/a
	name: frozen spinach
	amount: 1/2
	unit: lb
step 0:
Thaw the spinach at room temperature or in the microwave. Squeeze out the excess water. Set the spinach aside. Bring a large pot of water to a boil, then add the macaroni noodles. Boil for 7-10 minutes, or until al dente. Drain the macaroni in a colander.
step 1:
While the pasta is boiling, prepare the sauce. Add the butter and flour to a small sauce pot. Heat and stir the butter and flour over medium heat until it forms a creamy paste and begins to bubble. Continue to stir and cook for about one minute more.
step 2:
Whisk the milk into the butter and flour, then allow it to come up to a simmer, while whisking. When it reaches a simmer, the sauce will thicken. Remove the sauce from the heat.
step 3:
Whisk the Romano (or Parmesan) and pesto into the sauce until smooth. This will further thicken the sauce. Season the sauce with salt and freshly cracked pepper. Make sure the sauce is well seasoned as the flavors will be less concentrated once the pasta and spinach are stirred in.
step 4:
Return the cooked and drained pasta to the large pot (heat turned off) and add the thawed spinach. Pour the sauce over top, then stir until everything is combined and coated in sauce. Serve immediately.

	amount: 1
	unit: loaf
step 0:
Add the butter, olive oil, minced garlic, garlic powder, salt, and parsley to a bowl. Mix the ingredients together until they form a fairly smooth mixture.
step 1:
Slice the French bread into 1-inch thick slices (12-16 slices, depending on the size of the loaf). Add 1/2 to 1 Tbsp of the garlic spread to each slice of bread and spread it from edge to edge. Arrange the slices on a baking sheet and then place them in the freezer for about 30 minutes to allow the butter to firm up. Once firm, transfer the garlic bread to a gallon-sized freezer bag for longer storage. Store in the freezer up to three months.
step 2:
To cook the frozen slices of garlic bread, preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Once the oven is heated, take as many slices out of the freezer as you'd like, and place them on a baking sheet. Bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown.* If you prefer a softer garlic bread without crispy edges, wrap the slices in foil before baking.

	amount: 6
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Combine the olive oil, minced garlic, cumin, salt, and some freshly cracked pepper (about 10 cranks of a pepper mill) in a small bowl.
step 1:
Zest one of the limes and then squeeze the juice. You'll need 2-3 Tbsp juice, so if needed, juice half of the second lime. Cut the remaining lime into wedges to garnish the chicken once cooked. Roughly chop the cilantro.
step 2:
Add 1 tsp of the lime zest, 2-3 Tbsp of the lime juice, and half of the chopped cilantro to the marinade. Stir to combine. (The remaining cilantro will be added fresh after cooking the chicken.)
step 3:
Place the chicken thighs in a shallow dish or a large zip top bag. Add the marinade and toss the chicken to coat. Allow the chicken to marinate for 30 minutes or up to 8 hours (refrigerated), turning it once or twice as it marinates.
step 4:
When ready to cook the chicken, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the chicken and cook for 5-7 minutes on each side, or until well browned and cooked through. My chicken had enough of an oil coating from the marinade that I did not need to add any extra to the skillet.
step 5:
Top the cooked chicken with more fresh cilantro and a squeeze of fresh lime juice. Serve with any extra lime wedges.

step 0:
Prepare the stir fry sauce first. In a small bowl stir together the soy sauce, toasted sesame oil, sriracha, and brown sugar. Set the sauce aside.
step 1:
Shred the vegetables so they are ready to go when you need them. Cut one small cabbage in half, remove the core, and then finely shred the leaves of one half the cabbage (4-6 cups once shredded, save the other half for another recipe). Peel two carrots, then use a cheese grater to shred them (1 cup shredded). Slice three green onions. Mince two cloves of garlic. Peel a knob of ginger using either a vegetable peeler or by scraping with the side of a spoon, then grate it using a small-holed cheese grater.
step 2:
Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot add the cooking oil, ground beef, garlic, ginger, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook the beef until browned (about five minutes).
step 3:
Add the cabbage and carrots to the skillet and continue to stir and cook until the cabbage is slightly wilted (or fully wilted, if you prefer). Stir in the prepared sauce and the green onions. Top with a sprinkle of sesame seeds and a drizzle of sriracha, then serve.

	unit: n/a
step 0:
In a small bowl, combine the spices for the masala spice mix (garam masala, cumin, turmeric, smoked paprika, cayenne, salt, and pepper).
step 1:
Finely dice the onion, mince the garlic, and grate the ginger. Add all three to a large skillet along with the olive oil and sauté over medium heat until the onions are soft and translucent (about 3 minutes). Add the spice mix and continue to sauté for one more minute.
step 2:
Add the frozen cauliflower florets to the skillet with the aromatics and spices, and continue to sauté for about 5 minutes more, or until the cauliflower have thawed through and are completely coated in spices.
step 3:
Add the drained chickpeas, tomato sauce, and 1/4 cup water to the skillet. Stir to combine, then allow them to simmer over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, for about 15 minutes. This will help mellow the acidity of the tomato sauce and allow the spices to blend. If the mixture becomes too dry as it simmers, add a couple more tablespoons of water.
step 4:
After the sauce has simmered for 15 minutes, turn off the heat and stir in the heavy cream. Give the masala a taste and add salt as needed. Serve in a bowl either over rice or with a piece of bread for dipping.

step 0:
Dice the onion and mince the garlic. Sauté both in a large soup pot with the olive oil over medium heat until the onions are translucent. While the onion and garlic are sautéing, dice the bell peppers, then add them to the pot and continue to sauté for about two minutes more.
step 1:
Add the ground beef to the pot with the vegetables and continue to sauté over medium until the beef is cooked through. Add the red wine to the pot and stir to dissolve any browned bits off the bottom of the pot.
step 2:
Add the diced tomatoes (with juices), tomato sauce, soy sauce, bay leaves, oregano, basil, crushed red pepper, and water to the pot. Stir to combine, place a lid on the pot, and allow it to come up to a boil. Once boiling, turn it down to low, and let the sauce simmer for 30 minutes with the lid on, stirring occasionally.
step 3:
After the sauce has simmered for 30 minutes, add the macaroni and stir to combine. Continue to let the macaroni simmer in the sauce, with the lid on, stirring occasionally, until the pasta is tender (about 10-12 minutes).

step 0:
Preheat the oven to 350ºF. In a small bowl, combine the brown sugar, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, paprika, salt, and black pepper.
step 1:
Remove the pork chops from their package and rub the seasoning mixture over all sides of each chop. The moisture from the meat will help the seasoning to adhere to the surface.
step 2:
Heat olive oil in a large, oven­-safe skillet over a medium flame. When the oil begins to shimmer, add the pork chops. Cook the chops for about 5 minutes on each side, until nicely browned.
step 3:
If your chops are greater than one-inch thick, transfer the skillet to the preheated oven for another 5­-10 minutes to finish cooking. Test the chops with a meat thermometer to make sure the internal temperature has reached 145ºF. Cook longer if needed.
step 4:
Dredge the chops through the thick sauce in the bottom of the pan just before serving.

	amount: 4
	unit: oz.
step 0:
Thinly slice the onion and mince the garlic. Remove the red peppers from the liquid in the jar and then slice them into thin strips.
step 1:
In a large pot, combine the broth, onion, garlic, red pepper slices, diced tomatoes (with juice), basil, crushed red pepper, and some freshly cracked black pepper (10-15 cranks of a pepper mill). Stir these ingredients to combine. Break the fettuccine in half, then add it to the pot, attempting to submerge the pieces as much as possible.
step 2:
Place a lid on the pot and turn the heat up to high. As soon as the pot reaches a full boil, give it a quick stir to loosen any pieces that may have stuck to the bottom, return the lid, and turn the heat down to medium-low.
step 3:
Let the pot simmer on medium low for 10-12 minutes, stirring every couple of minutes to make sure nothing sticks to the bottom. Return the lid as quickly as possible after each stir. After ten minutes, test the pasta to see if it is al dente. Once the pasta is tender, remove it from the heat. (If the pasta becomes too dry before it is tender, simply add a small amount of water and continue to simmer.)
step 4:
Divide the cream cheese into tablespoon sized pieces, then add them to the pot. Stir the pasta until the cheese melts in and creates a smooth sauce (it will look lumpy at first, just keep stirring). Serve hot.

step 0:
In a small bowl, combine the herbs and spices for the blackening seasoning. Rinse the shrimp under cool water, drain, and then pat dry with a paper towel. Sprinkle the blackening seasoning over the shrimp and stir to coat.
step 1:
Bring a large pot of water to a boil for the pasta. Once boiling, add the pasta and cook until tender (7-10 minutes). Reserve about 1 cup of the starchy pasta water, then drain the pasta in a colander.
step 2:
While the pasta is cooking, mince the garlic and add it to a large skillet with the butter. Heat the butter and garlic over a medium flame until the butter starts to foam and sizzle. Continue to sauté the garlic in the sizzling butter for about one minute. Add the shrimp and sauté until they are opaque and slightly firm (3-5 minutes), then remove them from the skillet.
step 3:
Add the diced tomatoes (with juices) and about 1/2 cup of the pasta water to the skillet. Stir and cook over medium heat, dissolving the browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. Let the sauce simmer for 5-10 minutes, or until thickened slightly. Taste the sauce and add salt if needed (I added 1/4 tsp salt).
step 4:
Add the cooked and drained pasta to the skillet and toss with the sauce (add some of the remaining reserved pasta water, if needed, to loosen the pasta). Return the shrimp to the skillet and stir to combine.
step 5:
Slice the green onions and chop the parsley leaves. Sprinkle both over top. Serve with sliced lemon to squeeze over top.

To make the meatballs, squeeze the Italian sausage out of the casing and into a large bowl. Add the breadcrumbs, egg, and diced onion. Using your hands, mix the ingredients until combined. Form the mixture into about 24 ping pong ball sized balls.
step 1:
Heat a large skillet over medium flame. Add the olive oil and tilt the skillet to coat. Add the meatballs and cook until browned on the outside (a couple minutes on each side). Work in two batches if needed to give the meatballs room to movel around. Once the meatballs are browned, remove them from the skillet to a clean plate.
step 2:
Add the second half of the diced onion to the skillet, along with two cloves of minced garlic. Sauté in the leftover oil and fat from the meatballs until soft and transparent. Once soft, add the crushed tomatoes, oregano, basil, salt, pepper, brown sugar, and tomato paste. Stir until the tomato paste mixes into the crushed tomatoes.
step 3:
Add the meatballs back to the skillet and gently stir to coat them in sauce. Place a lid on the skillet and let the meatballs simmer in the sauce for 15 minutes. Cook the pasta while the meatballs simmer.
step 4:
Drain the pasta and serve each bowl with pasta, four meatballs, and a scoop of sauce.

Wash the cucumber well to remove wax or other residues. For a decorative look, peel alternating strips of the peel (see step by step photos below). Slice the cucumber into half-rounds.
step 1:
Cut the mango into slices by first cutting off both rounded “cheeks.” Score flesh of the mango into strips using a sharp paring knife. Use a spoon to scoop the flesh from the skin (see photos below). Cut the mango slices in half so that they are more similar in size to the cucumber slices.
step 2:
Next, prepare the dressing by combining the rice vinegar, sugar, salt and red pepper flakes in a small bowl. Stir until the sugar is completely dissolved.
step 3:
Add the sliced cucumber and mango to a large bowl, then pour the dressing over top. Stir to combine the ingredients and coat the cucumber and mango in dressing. Serve immediately or refrigerate until ready to eat. Stir well before serving each time to redistribute the dressing.

	amount: 1/2
	unit: n/a
	name: chicken drumsticks (about 1.75 lbs.)
	amount: 6
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Combine the olive oil, minced garlic, cumin, salt, and some freshly cracked pepper (about 10-15 cranks of a mill) in a bowl.
step 1:
Use a zester, microplane, or small-holed cheese grater to remove the zest from one of the limes. Add about 1 tsp zest and 3 Tbsp juice to the marinade.Pull the leaves from 1/4 bunch of cilantro and chop finely. Add the chopped cilantro to the marinade and stir to combine. The other 1/4 bunch of cilantro will be added after baking.
step 2:
Pour the marinade into a gallon sized zip top bag and add the chicken drumsticks. Close the bag tightly and massage to mix and coat the chicken pieces in the marinade. Refrigerate for 30 minutes, or longer if desired, turning the bag occasionally to redistribute the marinade.
step 3:
When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Add the chicken pieces to a casserole dish so they are all in one layer, trying not to overcrowd. Pour the rest of the marinade in the bag over the chicken.
step 4:
Bake the chicken for 40-45 minutes, basting once or twice throughout. For more browning, turn the broiler on at the end of the cooking time and broil for 2-4 minutes, or until the desired amount of browning is achieved. The total cooking time will ultimately depend on the size of your drumsticks and how closely they are packed together in the baking dish. Use a meat thermometer to make sure the meat has reached 160ºF to be sure.
step 5:
Garnish the chicken with fresh slices of lime and more chopped cilantro leaves.

step 0:
Peel the sweet potato and cut it into one-inch cubes. Place the cubes in a pot, cover with water, and bring to a boil over high heat. Boil the potatoes until they're tender and fall apart with pierced with a fork (about ten minutes). Drain the potatoes and set aside.
step 1:
Coat the inside of a 10-inch cast iron skillet with oil. Place it in the oven and begin to preheat the oven to 425 degrees.
step 2:
In a large bowl, stir together the cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg until well mixed.
step 3:
Mash the drained sweet potatoes until fairly smooth. Transfer 1.5 cups of the mashed potatoes to a large bowl. Add the sour cream, milk, and 2 Tbsp oil, and whisk until combined. Add the eggs and whisk until combined again.
step 4:
Pour the sweet potato mixture into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Stir the two together just until combined and no dry mix remains on the bottom of the bowl. It's okay if the mixture is a little lumpy, just be sure not to over mix.
step 5:
Carefully take the hot skillet out of the preheated oven and scoop the batter into it. Smooth the top out until it's even, then return it to the oven. Bake for 22-25 minutes, or until the center is puffed, the top is golden brown, and it's slightly cracked around the edges. Remove from the oven, cut into eight pieces, and serve. Preferably with butter.

	name: beef broth $0.08*
	amount: 2
	unit: cups
	name: shredded cheese
	amount: 1
	unit: cup
step 0:
Dice the onion and mince the garlic. Cook both in a large pot with olive oil over medium heat for 1-2 minutes, or until soft and transparent. Add the ground beef and continue to stir and cook until it is fully browned. If using a high fat ground beef, drain off the excessive after it is browned.
step 1:
Add the flour and chili powder to the pot and stir to coat the meat. Continue to stir and cook the coated meat for 1-2 minutes more. The flour and chili powder may coat the bottom of the pot, but that's okay. Just be careful to not let it burn.
step 2:
Drain and rinse the black and kidney beans. Add the beans, tomato sauce, diced tomato, and corn kernels to the pot. Stir well and dissolve the flour/chili powder mixture from the bottom of the pot.
step 3:
Add the dry macaroni and two cups of beef broth to the pot and stir to combine. Place a lid on top, turn the heat up to high, and let the pot come to a boil. Once it reaches a boil, give it a quick stir to loosen any pasta stuck to the bottom of the pot, replace the lid, and turn the heat down to medium-low. Let the pot simmer on medium-low for about 15 minutes, or until the pasta is soft and has absorbed most of the liquid. Stir the pot one or two times during the 15 minutes to loosen any pasta stuck to the bottom.
step 4:
Once the pasta is fully cooked, turn the heat off and add the cheese. Stir the cheese into the pasta until it has melted in and become slightly creamy. Serve hot.

	name: grated Parmesan
	amount: 1/3
	unit: cup
step 0:
Rinse the mushrooms and cut them into thick slices. Mince the garlic. Heat the garlic and olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat for one to two minutes, or until the garlic is soft and fragrant. Add the mushrooms, a pinch of salt and freshly cracked pepper, and continue to sauté until the mushrooms have softened and released all of their moisture (5-7 minutes).
step 1:
Add the uncooked orzo and chicken broth to the skillet. Give it a quick stir, place a lid on top, and let the mixture come up to a boil. Once it reaches a boil, give it quick stir again to loosen any pasta from the bottom of the skillet. Replace the lid, turn the heat down to low, and let the pasta simmer on low heat for 10 minutes. Stir once half way through to prevent the pasta from sticking.
step 2:
After ten minutes, test the orzo to make sure it's tender (if not, replace the lid and let simmer a few minutes more). Stir the contents of the skillet to redistribute any leftover broth (it will continue to absorb into the pasta). Once the broth has absorbed, turn off the heat.
step 3:
Sprinkle the Parmesan over the pasta, stir, and then serve.

step 0:
Mince the garlic. Add the garlic and butter to a large pot or skillet and sauté over medium heat for about one minute, or until the garlic is soft and fragrant. Add the ground beef and continue to sauté until it is fully browned.
step 1:
While the beef is browning, slice the mushrooms. Once the beef has browned, add the sliced mushrooms and some freshly cracked pepper to the pot. Continue to sauté until the mushrooms are soft (about five minutes). Add the flour and sauté for about two minutes more. The flour will coat the bottom of the pot and this is okay.
step 2:
Add the beef broth to the pot and stir to dissolve the flour off of the bottom. Add the uncooked egg noodles. Place a lid on the pot and allow the liquid to come up to a boil. As soon as it reaches a boil, give the pot a stir, replace the lid, and reduce the heat to low. Allow the pot to simmer for about 7-10 minutes, stirring the noodles and replacing the lid every couple of minutes. After 7-10 minutes the pasta should be tender and most of the liquid absorbed. Make sure the liquid is simmering the entire time. If not, increase the heat slightly.
step 3:
Once the noodles are tender, stir in the sour cream. Roughly chop a handful of parsley leaves and sprinkle over top. Serve hot.

step 0:
Preheat the oven to 400ºF. Peel the sweet potato and cut it into 1/2 to 3/4" cubes. Place the sweet potatoes and frozen broccoli florets (no need to thaw) on a large baking sheet.
step 1:
Drizzle the olive oil over the sweet potatoes and broccoli florets. Sprinkle the seasoning salt over the sweet potatoes and then season the broccoli florets with a pinch of salt and pepper. Use your hands to toss the vegetables until they are coated in oil and spices, keeping the sweet potatoes on one side of the baking sheet and the broccoli on the other.
step 2:
Transfer the baking sheet to the preheated oven and roast the vegetables for 15 minutes.
step 3:
While the vegetables are roasting, prepare the meatloaves. In a medium bowl combine the ground beef, egg, bread crumbs, 1 Tbsp of the BBQ sauce, the smoked paprika, garlic powder, and salt. Work the ingredients together with your hands or a fork until they are well combined. Divide the meatloaf mixture in two and shape each half into a flattened oval.
step 4:
After the vegetables have roasted for 15 minutes, remove the baking sheet and stir each of the vegetables. Push each off to the side a bit to make room for the meatloaves. Place the shaped meatloaves in the center and then spread 1 Tbsp of BBQ sauce over each loaf.
step 5:
Return the baking sheet to the oven and roast for an additional 20 minutes, or until the internal temperature of the meatloaves has reached 160ºF. Remove the baking sheet from the oven, plate up the meatloaves and vegetables, and serve immediately.

step 0:
Slice the smoked sausage into thin rounds, then cut any larger pieces in half. Add the sausage and vegetable oil to a large pot and cook over medium heat until the sausage is well browned (about 5 minutes).
step 1:
Mince two cloves of garlic and add them to the pot. Sauté for one minute, or until the garlic is soft and fragrant. Add the bag of frozen seasoning mix and sauté until heated through (3-5 minutes). Add the can of diced tomatoes (with juices), Creole seasoning, oregano, smoked paprika, thyme, freshly cracked pepper (about 20 cranks of a pepper mill), and pasta to the pot. Finally, add the chicken broth and 1 cup of water, and stir until everything is evenly combined.
step 2:
Place a lid on the pot and turn the heat up to medium-high. Let the pot come to a boil. As soon as it reaches a boil, stir briefly, replace the lid, turn the heat down to low, and let the pot simmer for 10-12 minutes, or until the pasta is tender. Stir the pot once every few minutes as it simmers to prevent the pasta from sticking. Replace the lid as quickly as possible to maintain a simmer. If the mixture still seems soupy at around 8 minutes, let the pot simmer without a lid for the last few minutes. A little bit of thick sauce at the bottom of the pot is perfect.
step 3:
While the pasta is simmering, chop the parsley and slice the green onions.
step 4:
Turn off the heat and stir in the half & half or cream. Stir in most of the chopped parsley and green onions, reserving some to sprinkle over top of each bowl. Serve hot.

step 1:
Whisk the milk into the flour and butter mixture. Turn the heat up slightly and allow the milk to come to a simmer while whisking. When it reaches a simmer, the mixture will thicken. Once it's thick enough to coat a spoon, turn off the heat.
step 2:
Stir in the shredded cheddar, one handful at a time, until melted into the sauce. If needed, place the pot over a low flame to help the cheese melt. Do not over heat the cheese sauce.
step 3:
Once all the cheese is melted into the sauce, stir in the salt and chili powder. Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed. If the sauce becomes too thick, simply whisk in an additional splash of milk.

	name: olive oil 
	amount: 2
	unit: Tbsp
	name: Italian seasoning 
	amount: 2
	unit: Tbsp
step 0:
The day before (about 18 hours ahead of time) combine the flour, salt, and yeast in a large bowl. Stir until well mixed. Add the water, starting with 1.5 cups, and add a little more at a time until the flour forms a cohesive, wet ball. There should not be any dry flour left on the bottom of the bowl. The total amount of water you’ll need will vary, but should be between 1.5 to 2 cups. See the photos below for more info.
step 1:
Loosely cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it sit at room temperature for 16-18 hours to ferment.
step 2:
After 16-18 hours, the dough will look like a large, bubbly mass. Sprinkle with enough flour to be able to scrape it out of the bowl without it sticking to your hands. Place the dough on a well floured surface. Cut the dough into 12 pieces. Shape each piece into a small ball. The dough will be quite wet, floppy, and sticky, so sprinkle liberally with flour as you work.
step 3:
Place the rolls on a baking sheet covered in foil and lightly sprayed with non-stick spray (I used two baking sheets). Brush the top of each lightly with olive oil. Sprinkle the Italian seasoning over top. Let rise for 30 minutes to one hour or until doubled in size.
step 4:
While the rolls are still rising, preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Once it is fully preheated, place the rolls in the oven and bake until the surface is a light golden brown (about 25 minutes). Serve warm!

step 0:
Preheat the oven to 400ºF. Chop the cauliflower into small florets and place them on a large baking sheet. Slice the red onion into 1/4-inch strips and place them on the baking sheet. Drizzle the cauliflower and onions with olive oil and season with a pinch or two of salt and pepper. Toss the cauliflower and onions until coated in oil, salt, and pepper.

step 2:
While the cauliflower and onions are roasting, make the lemon tahini dressing. Add the tahini, water, lemon juice, garlic, cumin, cayenne, and salt to a blender. Blend until smooth, then refrigerate until ready to serve.
step 3:
Drain and rinse the can of chickpeas. Add them to a skillet along with the olive oil, smoked paprika, cayenne, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Stir and cook the chickpeas over medium heat for about five minutes, or until they sizzle and become slightly crispy. Remove the chickpeas from the heat.
step 4:
Pull the parsley leaves from their stems and roughly chop the leaves into small pieces (about 1.5 cups loosely packed, once chopped).
step 5:
To build the salad, combine the roasted cauliflower and onions in a bowl with the spiced chickpeas and chopped parsley. Drizzle the lemon tahini dressing over top, and toss to combine. Serve warm or cold.

	unit: tsp
step 0:
Prepare the ingredients before beginning because the process goes quickly once it's begun. Thaw the broccoli florets and chop them into small bite-sized pieces. Slice the bacon into small pieces. Shred the cheddar cheese.
step 1:
Cook the pasta according to the package directions (boil 7-10 minutes, or until al dente). Drain the pasta in a colander and set it aside.
step 2:
Return the pot to the stove, add the bacon, and cook over medium to medium-low heat until the bacon is brown and crispy (about 5 minutes). Use a slotted spoon to remove the bacon from the pot, leaving the grease behind.
step 3:
Add the evaporated milk, smoked paprika, Dijon, hot sauce, and salt to the pot with the bacon grease. Stir to combine and allow it to heat through (it should heat quickly as the pot will be very hot from cooking the bacon).
step 4:
Once the evaporated milk is hot, turn the heat to low and begin whisking in the shredded cheddar, one handful at a time, waiting until the cheese is fully melted before adding the next handful. Once all of the cheese has been melted into the sauce, taste the cheese sauce and adjust the salt or hot sauce if desired. If the sauce becomes too thick, simply stir in one to two tablespoons of the remaining evaporated milk in the can.
step 5:
Return the cooked pasta, crispy bacon (crumble into smaller pieces if desired), and chopped broccoli to the pot with the cheese sauce. Stir to combine. Serve immediately.

step 0:
Place the chicken, pasta, and Rotel tomatoes (undrained) in a large skillet. Add two cups of chicken broth and stir to combine. Cover the skillet with a tight fitting lid, turn the heat on to high, and let it come to a boil. Once it reaches a boil, reduce the heat to low and let it simmer for 15 minutes, giving it a quick stir every 5 minutes or so.
step 1:
Meanwhile, cook the bacon in a skillet until brown and crispy. Drain the cooked bacon on a paper towel, then crumble into pieces.
step 2:
After simmering for 15 minutes, the pasta should be tender and most of the liquid absorbed. If the pasta is still firm, let the skillet simmer for 5 more minutes. If the pasta is tender, but there is still a lot of liquid in the skillet, let it simmer without a lid for 5 more minutes.
step 3:
Once the pasta is cooked and most of the liquid is absorbed, drizzle the BBQ sauce over top. Sprinkle the shredded cheese over the BBQ sauce and cover the skillet with the lid. Leave the heat set on low and let the skillet sit for five minutes to melt the cheese. Once the cheese is melted, top with the crumbled bacon and sliced green onions, then serve.

In a large bowl, whisk together the egg, 2 Tbsp cornstarch, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Trim any excess fat from the chicken thighs, then cut them into small 1 inch pieces. Toss the chicken in the egg and cornstarch mixture.
step 2:
Add the cooking oil to a large skillet and heat it over medium flame. Wait until the skillet is very hot, then swirl the skillet to make sure the oil coats the entire surface. Add the batter coated chicken and spread it out into a single layer over the surface of the skillet. 
step 3:
Allow the chicken pieces to cook, undisturbed, until golden brown on the bottom. Then, carefully flip the chicken, breaking up the pieces into smaller clumps as you flip. Continue to cook the chicken until golden brown on the other side. Stir the chicken as little as possible to avoid breaking the egg coating from the surface of the chicken.
step 4:
Once the chicken is cooked through and golden brown on all sides, pour the sauce over top. Toss the chicken to coat in the sauce. As the sauce comes up to a simmer, it will begin to thicken. Continue to gently stir the chicken in the sauce until it has thickened, then turn off the heat.
step 5:
Serve the chicken over a bed of rice and sprinkle the sliced green onions over top.

step 0:
OPTIONAL: Freeze the tofu at least a day before, then thaw before pressing. This gives the tofu a more firm and less jelly-like texture.
step 1:
Remove the tofu from the package and place it on a baking sheet. Place a cutting board or a smaller baking sheet on top, then place something heavy on top, like a pot full of water, or a cast iron skillet. Allow the tofu to press for about 30 minutes to remove excess water. (If you previously froze the tofu, you can press for about half the time because the water comes out much more quickly.)
step 2:
Once pressed, transfer the tofu to a cutting board and roughly chop into random 1/2-inch sized pieces. Place the chopped tofu in a bowl.
step 3:
In a separate small bowl, stir together the smoked paprika, garlic powder, salt, and some freshly cracked pepper. Sprinkle this over the tofu, then gently stir the tofu until it is coated in the spices.
step 4:
Add 1 tsp cornstarch to the tofu and gently fold until coated. Repeat two more times until 1 Tbsp cornstarch total has been added to the tofu.
step 5:
Heat 2 Tbsp cooking oil in a large non-stick skillet over medium heat (cast-iron or teflon, your choice). Once the oil is very hot, add the tofu to the skillet. Let the tofu cook, stirring only occasionally, for about ten minutes, or until it appears firm and darkened on the outside edges.
step 6:
Remove the tofu from the heat, add the 1/4 cup BBQ sauce, and stir to coat.
step 7:
While the tofu is cooking, prepare the simple coleslaw. In a medium bowl stir together the mayonnaise, honey, Dijon, vinegar, salt, and pepper. Add the shredded cabbage coleslaw mix, then stir until it is coated in the dressing.
step 8:
To serve the sliders, scoop about 1/3 of the BBQ tofu onto each bun, then drizzle each with an extra tablespoon of BBQ sauce. Finish each slider off with a heaping scoop of the simple coleslaw and finally, the top half of the bun. Enjoy!

step 0:
Dice the onion and mince the garlic. Add the onion, garlic, and olive oil to a large pot and sauté over medium heat for about 5 minutes, or until the onions are soft and transparent.
step 1:
While the onion and garlic are sautéing, wash and slice the carrots and celery. Add them to the pot and continue to sauté for a few minutes more.
step 2:
Pull the skin and any excess fat from the chicken breasts. Add the breasts to the pot along with the bay leaf, basil, parsley, thyme, some freshly cracked pepper, and eight cups of water. Cover the pot, bring it to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for one hour. Make sure the pot continues to simmer for the whole hour. If the heat is turned down too low and it is not bubbling away, the chicken will not shred easily.
step 3:
After an hour of simmering, remove the chicken from the pot. Using two forks, pull the meat from the bone and shred it slightly. Season the broth with salt. Begin with one teaspoon and add more to your liking. I used 2-3 teaspoons. The flavor of the broth will really pop once the salt is added.
step 4:
Add the noodles to the pot, turn the heat up to high, and boil the noodles until tender (about 7 minutes). Return the shredded chicken to the pot. Taste and season again with salt if needed (I didn’t need to). Serve hot!

	amount: 2
	unit: Tbsp
	name: milk
	amount: 1
	unit: cup
step 0:
Dice the onion and add it to a deep, oven safe skillet with 3 Tbsp butter. Sauté the onions over medium heat until soft and transparent. Add 3 Tbsp flour and continue to sauté for about two minutes. Whisk in one cup milk until no lumps remain. Add the salt, thyme, sage, and some freshly cracked pepper. Allow the milk to come up to a simmer, whisking often, until it thickens.
step 1:
Whisk in the vegetable broth and allow it to come up to a simmer again. You should now have a thick, creamy sauce. Add the frozen vegetables (no need to thaw) and stir to combine. Turn the heat down to low and allow the mixture to heat through, stirring occasionally, while you prepare the biscuit topping.
step 2:
Preheat the oven to 425ºF. In a large bowl stir together the flour, baking powder, and salt until well combined. Cut the butter into several chunks, add it to the flour mixture, then use your hands or a pastry cutter to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles damp sand. Stir in the cheddar and chives.
step 3:
Add 1 cup milk to the biscuit mixture and stir until a dough forms. If the dough seems is too wet or sticky to work with your hands, simply dust a little more flour on top.
step 4:
Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and press it down into a 3/4-inch thick circle, then cut into 6 biscuits (gather up the scraps and reshape to cut more biscuits if needed). Place the biscuits over top of the vegetable pot pie mixture in the skillet.
step 5:
Bake the skillet for 18-20 minutes, or until the biscuits are golden brown on top and the filling is bubbly around the edges. Serve hot.

	name: cream cheese
	amount: 2
	unit: oz. 
	name: medium cheddar, shredded
	amount: 3
	unit: oz.
step 0:
Add the macaroni and vegetable broth to the rice cooker. Close the lid and cook on the "steam" setting for 5 minutes. It may take 5-7 minutes to come up to temperature before it begins counting down the 5 minutes of cook time. Stir the pasta twice during cooking, once when the cook time begins to count down, and again when there is about 2 minutes left. Close the lid promptly after stirring each time.
step 1:
While the pasta is cooking, cut the cream cheese into chunks. After 5 minutes of cooking, the pasta should have absorbed all of the broth (if not, cook a few minutes longer). Turn the rice cooker to the "keep warm" setting, and add the milk and cream cheese. Stir until the cream cheese has melted.
step 2:
Finally, add half of the shredded cheddar and stir until it has melted, then repeat with the second half. If the cheese sauce becomes too thick or dry for your liking, simply stir in an extra splash of milk. Serve hot.

	name: salt and pepper to taste
	amount: n/a
	unit: n/a
	name: grated Parmesan
	amount: 1
	unit: Tbsp
step 0:
Bring a pot of water to a boil for the ravioli. Once boiling, add the ravioli and cook until tender (check package for specific cooking times, as this can vary with the ravioli size or whether it is fresh or dried). Once cooked, reserve 1/4 cup of the cooking water, then drain the ravioli in a colander.
step 1:
While the ravioli is cooking, prepare the rest of the dish. Mince the garlic and chop the walnuts before you begin the sage brown butter sauce, since the sauce cooks very quickly.
step 2:
Add the butter to a large skillet and melt it over medium-low heat, stirring continuously. Once the butter begins to sizzle and becomes foamy (about 2-3 minutes), add the minced garlic and chopped walnuts. Continue to stir and cook over medium-low heat until the sediment in the skillet turns deep golden brown (about 3-5 minutes). Once it becomes browned, remove it from the heat, and stir in the dried sage.
step 3:
Add the spinach and the 1/4 cup reserved ravioli cooking water to the skillet. Return the skillet to low heat, and stir until the spinach is wilted (about 2 minutes). Taste the spinach and add salt to taste. Finally, add the cooked and drained ravioli to the skillet with the spinach and sage brown butter sauce, then toss to coat.
step 4:
Serve the ravioli with a light dusting of grated Parmesan and freshly cracked pepper over top.

step 0:
Combine the ingredients for the Cajun seasoning in a small bowl. Cut the chicken into 1/2 to 3/4-inch cubes. Place the cubed chicken in a bowl, pour the Cajun seasoning over top, and stir to coat the chicken in spices.
step 1:
Add the olive oil and butter to a large deep skillet. Heat the oil and butter over medium-high until the skillet is very hot and the butter is melted and foamy. Add the seasoned chicken to the skillet and cook for a couple minutes on each side, or just until the outside gets some color. The chicken does not need to be cooked through at this point.
step 2:
Add the diced yellow onion to the skillet and continue to sauté for about 2 minutes more, or just until the onion begins to soften. Allow the moisture from the onion to dissolve any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet.
step 3:
Next, add the pasta, fire roasted diced tomatoes (with the juices), and chicken broth to the skillet. Stir just until everything is evenly combined, then place a lid on top and allow the broth to come up to a boil.
step 4:
Once boiling, turn the heat down to medium-low and let the pasta simmer for about ten minutes, stirring every couple of minutes, until the pasta is tender and the liquid is thick and saucy.

step 0:
Add the ground beef, Italian sausage, beaten egg, breadcrumbs, Parmesan, onion powder, garlic powder, and salt to a bowl. Use your hands to combine the ingredients until they are evenly mixed. Divide the mixture into four equal portions, then shape each into a ball.
step 1:
Place the meatballs in the slow cooker and pour the marinara over top, making sure to coat the top of each meatball. The sauce will only come up about half way to the top of the meatballs, but that's okay. The slow cooker will fill with steam, which will help cook the meatballs even though they are not completely submerged.
step 2:
Place the lid on the slow cooker and then cook on high for 3 hours, or low for 6-7 hours. Use an instant read thermometer to make sure the meatballs have reached at least 160ºF on the inside (mine had exceeded this temperature after 3 hours on high). 
step 3:
Near the end of the cook time, cook the spaghetti according to the package directions, and then drain in a colander.
step 4:
Remove the cooked meatballs from the slow cooker, then add the cooked and drained spaghetti, and toss it to coat in the sauce. Divide the sauced spaghetti between four plates, add one giant meatball to each, then enjoy.

step 0:
Dice the onion and mince the garlic. Add the olive oil, onion, and garlic to a large soup pot and begin to sauté over medium heat.
step 1:
While the onion and garlic are sautéing, dice the celery, then add it to the pot and continue to sauté. As the celery, onion, and garlic are sautéing, peel and chop the carrots into half rounds. Add the carrots to the pot and continue to sauté.
step 2:
As the onion, garlic, celery, and carrots are sautéing, peel and cube the potatoes into 3/4 to 1-inch pieces. Add the cubed potatoes to the pot along with the lentils, rosemary, thyme, Dijon, soy sauce, brown sugar, and vegetable broth.
step 3:
Briefly stir the ingredients to combine, then place a lid on the pot, turn the heat up to high, and bring the stew up to a boil. Once it reaches a boil, turn the heat down to low and let it simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
step 4:
Toward the end of the simmer time, when the potatoes are very soft, begin to mash the potatoes a bit as you stir. This will help thicken the stew.
step 5:
Finally, after 30 minutes, stir in the frozen peas and allow them to heat through. Taste the stew and add salt if needed (this will depend on the salt content of your broth, I did not add any extra). Serve hot and enjoy!

	name: chopped cilantro
	amount: 1/4
	unit: cup
	name: lime (cut into wedges)
	amount: 1
	unit: n/a
step 0:
In a medium bowl, whisk together the coconut milk, peanut butter, sriracha, brown sugar, soy sauce, lime juice, minced garlic, and grated ginger. If needed, gently heat the sauce in the microwave or in a sauce pot to help the peanut butter melt into the coconut milk. Taste the sauce and adjust the heat (sriracha), salt (soy sauce), sweetness (brown sugar), or tartness (lime juice) to your liking.
step 1:
Chop your vegetables, if not pre-chopped. Heat the cooking oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Once hot, add the vegetables to the skillet in order of hardest to softest to allow harder vegetables, like carrots, more time to cook and to avoid over cooking softer vegetables. Stir fry the vegetables only for about 1-2 minutes, or just until they begin to soften on the edges because they will cook further once the sauce is added. If using a tender green, like spinach, wait to add it to the skillet until after the sauce has been added.
step 2:
Pour the prepared spicy coconut sauce over the vegetables, stir to combine, and allow the sauce to heat through (about 2 minutes). If you are using a tender green, like spinach, stir it into the hot sauce and stir just until it has wilted.
step 3:
To serve, spoon the vegetables and sauce over a bowl of hot rice, or add pre-cooked noodles to the skillet and toss with the vegetables and sauce until combined. Top with chopped peanuts, cilantro, and serve with a wedge of lime to squeeze over top.

step 0:
Remove the zest from the orange using a zester or small-holed cheese grater, then squeeze the juice from the orange. You'll need about 1 tsp zest and 1/2 cup juice. Combine the juice and 1 tsp zest with the soy sauce, brown sugar, rice vinegar, grated ginger, minced garlic, red pepper flakes, and 1/2 Tbsp cornstarch in a small sauce pot. Before placing it over heat, whisk until the cornstarch is fully dissolved. Heat the mixture over medium-low until it begins to simmer, thicken, and turns into a glossy glaze (about 3-5 minutes). Remove the sauce from heat and set it aside.
step 1:
Use a sharp knife to remove any excess fat from the chicken thighs, then cut them into small 3/4-inch pieces.
step 2:
Combine the egg, 2 Tbsp cornstarch, and a pinch of salt and pepper in a mixing bowl and whisk until the mixture is smooth and frothy. Add the chicken pieces and stir to coat them in the egg mixture.
step 3:
Heat a large skillet over medium to medium-high heat. Once hot, add 2 Tbsp cooking oil and swirl to coat the bottom of the skillet. Add the chicken, making sure all the pieces are touching the surface and not piled on top of one another. Let the pieces cook until they are golden brown on the bottom.
step 4:
Flip the chicken pieces, breaking them apart from one another as you turn them. Let them cook until golden brown on the second side and cooked through (about 5-7 minutes total cooking).
step 5:
Turn the heat off under the skillet and pour on the prepared orange sauce. Stir to coat the chicken pieces in sauce.
step 6:
Serve the chicken and sauce over cooked rice, garnished with sliced green onions and any left over orange zest.

	unit: tsp
step 0:
Rinse the quinoa well with cool water in a fine wire mesh sieve. Add the quinoa and 1.75 cups water to a sauce pot. Place a lid on the pot, turn the heat up to high, and allow it to come to a boil. Once boiling, turn the heat down to low, and let the quinoa continue to simmer for 15 minutes (lid on).
step 1:
After 15 minutes of simmering, turn the heat off, and let the quinoa rest for 5 minutes.
step 2:
While the quinoa is simmering, prepare the butternut squash. Cut the ends off the squash to provide a flat sturdy surface. Use a vegetable peeler to peel the squash. Cut the squash in half, lengthwise, then scoop out the seeds. Finally, dice the remaining squash.
step 3:
When the quinoa is finished cooking, add it to a large bowl along with the frozen corn. Stir to combine, allowing the hot quinoa to thaw the corn. Set the bowl aside.
step 4:
Next cook the butternut squash. Add the cooking oil to a large skillet and place it over medium heat. Once hot, add the diced squash and a pinch of salt. Sauté the squash until it is tender and slightly browned (about 15 minutes). If the squash begins to stick, add a tablespoon or two of water and allow the steam to loosen the squash.
step 5:
While the squash is cooking, rinse and drain the black beans, and prepare the dressing. In a small bowl, combine the chopped fresh parsley, chopped fresh cilantro, three cloves of minced garlic, 1/4 cup olive oil, 2 Tbsp red wine vinegar, 1 tsp dried oregano, 1/2 tsp ground cumin, 1 tsp chipotle powder, and 1 tsp salt. Stir to combine.
step 6:
When the butternut squash is finished cooking, add it to the bowl with the corn and quinoa. Also add the rinsed and drained black beans, and the prepared dressing. Stir to combine, then season with salt to taste, if needed. Enjoy immediately or refrigerate until ready to eat!

step 0:
Wash and slice the mushrooms. Add the olive oil and mushrooms to a large soup pot and sauté over medium heat until the mushrooms are fully wilted and browned on the edges (cook until all the moisture is released, evaporated, and the mushrooms begin to actually brown for the best flavor).
step 1:
While the mushrooms are sautéing, mince the garlic, dice the onion, slice the celery, and peel and slice the carrots.
step 2:
Add the garlic, onion, celery, carrots, thyme, and sage to the pot with the mushrooms. Continue to sauté for about five minutes more, or until the onions are soft.
step 3:
Finally, add the wild rice blend and vegetable broth, and stir to combine. Place a lid on the pot, turn the heat up to medium-high, and bring it to a boil. Once boiling, turn the heat down and let the soup simmer for about 45 minutes with the lid in place (or however long the instructions on your brand of rice suggests for cooking).
step 4:
Once the soup has simmered and the rice is tender, add the coconut milk. Stir to combine and allow it to simmer for about 5 minutes more. Finally, taste the soup and add salt if needed (I did not add any, but this will depend on the salt content of your broth). Serve hot with crusty bread for dipping!

	name: lemon curd
	amount: 3/4
	unit: cup
	name: blueberries
	amount: 1
	unit: cup
step 0:
Preheat the oven to 400ºF. Combine the dry ingredients for the blueberry biscuits in a bowl (flour, salt, sugar, and baking powder). Stir until very well combined. Stir 1 cup blueberries into the dry ingredients.
step 1:
Pour 1 cup heavy whipping cream into the bowl of dry ingredients and stir until it forms a ball of dough (avoid over stirring). It's okay for the dough to be slightly sticky, just make sure no dry flour remains on the bottom of the bowl.
step 2:
Using extra flour if necessary to keep your hands from sticking, divide the dough into six equal sized pieces. Shape one each into a ball and place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
step 3:
Bake the blueberry biscuits for 23-25 minutes, or until they are golden brown. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and allow the biscuits to cool.
step 4:
While the blueberry biscuits are baking, make the homemade vanilla whipped cream. Add the heavy whipping cream, vanilla, and sugar to a glass or metal bowl. Use a stand mixer or hand mixer to whip the cream until it forms stiff peaks. Refrigerate the whipped cream until you're ready to assemble the shortcakes.
step 5:
Once the biscuits are cool enough to handle, carefully slice them in half to create a top and bottom piece. Add a large dollop or two of vanilla whipped cream to each bottom piece, top with a couple tablespoons of lemon curd and a sprinkle of fresh blueberries, and then place the other half of the biscuit on top. Enjoy immediately.

	unit: cup
	name: sugar
	amount: 2
	unit: Tbsp
	name: vanilla extract
	amount: 1
	unit: tsp
step 0:
Rinse the strawberries well, then remove the stems and leaves by scooping them out with a spoon. Slice the strawberries lengthwise into about four slices each. Place the sliced strawberries in a bowl, add 2 Tbsp sugar, stir, and set them aside. The sugar will draw out the juice from the strawberries as they sit and create a delicious strawberry syrup. Stir the strawberries occasionally as they sit.
step 1:
Begin to preheat the oven to 400ºF for the biscuits. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Stir together the flour, salt, sugar, and baking powder in a bowl until they are very well combined.
step 2:
Add the heavy whipping cream to the bowl with the flour and stir until a sticky dough forms and no dry flour remains on the bottom of the bowl. 
step 3:
Dust your hands with flour, then divide the dough into eight pieces, and roughly shape the pieces into circles, about an inch to an inch and a half thick. Place the shaped biscuits onto the baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven for about 25 minutes, or until they are lightly golden brown on top.
step 4:
While the biscuits are baking, prepare the vanilla whipped cream. Add the heavy whipping cream, sugar, and vanilla to a glass or metal bowl. Whisk vigorously by hand, or use a mixer, until soft peaks form. Be careful not to over whisk the cream, or it can break and separate. 
step 5:
Once the biscuits have baked, let them sit until they are cool enough to handle. Carefully slice the biscuits in half. Spoon some of the strawberries and strawberry syrup from the bottom of the bowl onto the bottom of each biscuit. Top with a large dollop of whipped cream, then the top half of the biscuit. Finish each stack off with one more dollop of whipped cream, a few strawberry slices, and a drizzle of the strawberry syrup.

	unit: tsp
	name: salt
	amount: 1
	unit: pinch
	name: heavy whipping cream
	amount: 1
	unit: pint
step 0:
Peel and chop your peaches into small pieces (smaller pieces "float" in the whipped ice cream instead of sinking to the bottom). Add the butter and chopped peaches to a skillet and sauté over medium-low for about 5 minutes, or until the peaches have softened. Make sure the butter does not brown during this step.
step 1:
Add the brown sugar and balsamic vinegar to the skillet. Turn the heat up to medium and sauté for about 5 minutes more, or until the balsamic vinegar has reduced to a glaze. Set the balsamic peaches aside to allow them to cool.
step 2:
Add the sweetened condensed milk to a medium bowl and stir in the vanilla extract and a pinch of salt.
step 3:
Using either a whisk, a hand mixer, or a stand mixer, whip the heavy whipping cream to stiff peaks in a separate bowl.
step 4:
Add a large dollop of the whipped cream to the bowl with the sweetened condensed milk. Fold the ingredients together to lighten up the sweetened condensed milk.
step 5:
Add 1/3 of the lightened sweetened condensed milk back to the bowl with the whipped cream and gently fold them together. Repeat that two more times until all of the sweetened condensed milk has been folded into the whipped cream.
step 6:
Pour the whipped ice cream mixture into a 2-quart, freezer safe container. If your container is deep (like a bread pan), add half of the whipped mixture first, top with half of the balsamic peaches, then repeat. If using a wider shallow dish (like the baking dish in my photos), you can do one layer of whipped ice cream and then just top with the balsamic peaches.
step 7:
Use a spatula to lightly swirl the balsamic peaches into the whipped ice cream mixture. Do not over stir here. You want distinguishable ribbons of balsamic glaze. Just run the spatula through the mixture once.
step 8:
Cover the dish and freeze the ice cream for 8 hours, or until solid, then serve.

	name: chocolate graham crackers
	amount: 4
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Make the vanilla whipped cream first by placing the heavy whipping cream, granulated sugar, and vanilla extract in a bowl. Use a whisk or a mixer to beat the cream until it forms soft peaks (when you lift the whisk it form a peak that droops over to the side). Set the whipped cream aside.
step 1:
In a separate bowl, whip together the peanut butter, cream cheese, powdered sugar, and milk until it is light and creamy. A hand mixer or bench mixer is suggested for this, since the mixture will be quite thick. Start on low power to prevent the powdered sugar from spraying, and increase to medium once the powder sugar has incorporated.
step 2:
Add 1/3 of the whipped cream to the peanut butter mixture and gently fold them together. Once incorporated, gently fold in about 1/3 more of the whipped cream, leaving the last 1/3 to top the cups. Fold the whipped cream and peanut butter mixture together until smooth and fluffy.
step 3:
Place three of the four graham crackers in a zip top bag and crush with a rolling pin, or place them in a food processor and process until they are in crumbs. 
step 4:
Divide the graham cracker crumbs between four cups or containers, saving a small amount to sprinkle on top. Divide the peanut butter fluff between the four cups, then top with the remaining vanilla whipped cream. Sprinkle a pinch of the graham cracker crumbs on top of each, then break the last graham cracker into four pieces and place one piece in each cup. 
step 5:
You can serve the cups immediately, or refrigerate until chilled, which will give you a more solid, cheesecake-like texture (they're more like mousse when freshly made).

	name: vegetable broth
	amount: 1.5
	unit: cups
step 0:
Begin by preparing the vegetables. Wash and slice the mushrooms, wash and dice the celery, peel and shred the carrots (use a large-holed cheese grater), dice the onion, mince the garlic, and chop the parsley.
step 1:
Add 3 Tbsp of the butter to a large pot along with the sliced mushrooms. Sauté the mushrooms over medium heat until they have released all of their moisture and have begun to caramelize and brown on the edges (about 5-7 minutes).
step 2:
Add the garlic, onion, sage, thyme, some freshly cracked pepper, and 1/4 tsp salt to the pot. Continue to sauté the onions are soft and transparent (about 3-5 minutes), add the celery and continue to sauté for a few minutes more. Finally, add the shredded carrots and continue to sauté for a couple more minutes, or just until the carrots begin to soften.
step 3:
While sautéing the vegetables, add the chopped walnuts to a dry skillet. Cook and stir the walnut pieces over medium heat for 2-3 minutes, or just until they begin to give off a nutty aroma. Remove them from the heat immediately.
step 4:
Finally, add the toasted walnuts, the remaining 3 Tbsp butter, and a handful of fresh parsley to the pot. Stir until the butter has fully melted. Taste the vegetable mixture and add a touch more salt if needed. It should be well seasoned.
step 5:
Preheat the oven to 350ºF. Cut the stale bread into 1/2-inch cubes. Add the cubes to the pot with the sautéed vegetables and herbs. Stir well to coat the bread in the butter. Finally, pour in the vegetable broth, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring well each time before adding more. The bread will not be completely saturated, but will absorb more moisture as the stuffing bakes.
step 6:
Coat the inside of a 3-quart casserole dish with non-stick spray. Add the stuffing mixture to the casserole dish, spread it out evenly, and compress it down slightly. Cover the dish with foil. Bake the stuffing in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, then remove the foil and bake for an additional 15 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and crispy. Garnish with any remaining chopped parsley just before serving.

step 0:
Rinse the cranberries then add them to a small sauce pot with the sugar, water, and salt.
step 1:
If using a jalapeño, remove the stem, slice it lengthwise, scrape out the seeds (or leave some in if you like it extra spicy), then finely dice the pepper. Add the diced pepper to the sauce pot.
step 2:
Stir the pot to combine, place a lid on top, and place it over medium-high heat. Allow the pot to come to a boil. Once it reaches a boil, give it a good stir, turn the heat down to medium-low, and let it simmer without a lid for 5 minutes.
step 3:
After simmering for 5 minutes, the cranberries should have all burst open and created a thick sauce. Turn the heat off and transfer the sauce to the refrigerator to cool.
step 4:
Place the cream cheese on a small plate or in a shallow bowl. Use the back of a spoon to create an indentation along the center of the block of cream cheese.
step 5:
Pour the cooled cranberry sauce over the cream cheese, then top with sliced green onion. Serve with crackers and apple slices.

	amount: n/a
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Rinse the mushrooms to remove any dirt or debris, then slice them thinly. Mince the garlic.
step 1:
Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and sauté for 1-2 minutes or just until soft and fragrant. Add the sliced mushrooms and continue to sauté until they are soft, dark, and all of the moisture they release has evaporated (5 minutes).
step 2:
Make sure that all of the moisture released by the mushrooms has evaporated and just the butter oil and mushrooms remain in the pan. Turn the heat down to medium-low, add the flour, and continue to sauté the flour with the mushrooms and butter. The flour will form a paste like mixture all over the mushrooms and eventually begin to coat the bottom of the skillet. Continue to sauté for 3-4 minutes, or just until the flour begins to turn golden brown on the bottom of the skillet. This will slightly toast the flour and give the gravy better flavor.
step 3:
Slowly whisk in the vegetable broth. Whisk well to make sure that all of the flour has dissolved off the bottom of the skillet and no lumps remain. Add the sprigs of thyme, sage, and some freshly cracked pepper. Stir to combine.
step 4:
Allow the mixture to come to a simmer. The gravy will begin to thicken as soon as it simmers. Allow the gravy to simmer for 7-10 minutes, whisking often, until it is the desired thickness. Remember that the gravy will continue to thicken as it cools. Taste the gravy and adjust salt and pepper to your liking.

step 0:
Use a microplane, zester, or small-holed cheese grater to remove the thin layer of yellow zest from the lemon. Set the zest aside. Remove the stems from the green beans and, if you prefer shorter pieces, snap them in half. Place the green beans in a colander and rinse well with cool water.
step 1:
Transfer the rinsed green beans to a deep skillet. Add about one inch of fresh water (the water will not cover the beans). Place a lid on the skillet and turn the flame on to medium-high. Allow the water to come up to a boil. Let the beans simmer and steam for 3-5 minutes, or just until the beans are bright green and just slightly tender. Test the texture with a fork.
step 2:
Once the green beans are bright green and slightly tender, turn off the heat and drain them in a colander. Return the drained green beans to the still-warm skillet with the heat turned off.
step 3:
Add the butter, about 1/2 tsp of lemon zest, a quick squeeze of the lemon juice (about 1 tsp), a pinch of salt, and some freshly cracked pepper. Toss the green beans to distribute the seasonings and allow the residual heat to melt the butter.
step 4:
When the butter has melted fully, taste the green beans and add more salt, pepper, lemon juice, or lemon zest to your liking. Serve immediately.

	name: onion
	amount: 1
	unit: n/a
	name: apple cider
	amount: 1/2
	unit: cup
step 0:
Preheat the oven to 350ºF. Place the butter, sage, rosemary, thyme, and salt in a small bowl and mix them together until they form a paste. 
step 1:
Pat the split turkey breast dry with a paper towel, then use your hand to separate the skin from the breast meat, leaving it intact on the sides, and creating a pocket to fill with the herb butter. Spread about 1/3 of the butter herb mixture under the skin. Spread the remaining herb butter on top of the skin and all over the exterior of the turkey breast.
step 2:
Slice the apple and onion into wedges. Sprinkle the apple and onion wedges in the bottom of a casserole dish, then place the seasoned turkey breast on top. Pour 1/2 cup apple cider into the bottom of the casserole dish.
step 3:
Transfer the casserole dish to the oven and roast the turkey for about 1.5 hours, or until the internal temperature reaches 165ºF. Begin to check the turkey after 1 hour. If the top begins to brown too much before the internal temperature reaches its mark, cover the turkey with foil as it bakes (I did not need to do this). Make sure to test the temperature in the thickest part of the breast, without touching bone. 
step 4:
Let the turkey breast rest for at least 10 minutes before slicing and serving. Serve the roasted apples and onions along with the sliced breast and spoon the drippings over top.

	amount: 1
	unit: cup
	name: unbaked 9-inch deep dish pie crust
	amount: 1
	unit: n/a
step 0:
Preheat the oven to 425ºF. Cut the butter into four tablespoon-sized chunks, then add them to a small skillet. Heat the butter over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the butter solids turn deep brown and develop a nutty aroma (it will first become foamy, then the solids will sink to the bottom and turn brown). Remove the butter from the heat immediately to prevent burning, and carefully pour it into a mixing bowl.
step 1:
Add the maple syrup, brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, and salt to the bowl with the brown butter. Stir to combine.
step 2:
Add the eggs and pumpkin purée to the bowl with the butter and spices. Whisk until smooth. Lastly, add the evaporated milk, and whisk until smooth again.
step 3:
Place the pie dish with pie crust on a baking sheet for easy transport in and out of the oven. Pour the pumpkin mixture into the crust. Transfer the filled crust to the oven.
step 4:
Bake the pie for 15 minutes at 425ºF, then turn the heat down to 350ºF and continue to bake for 35-40 minutes more, or until the pie is slightly domed on top, lightly browned around the edges, and the center is no longer liquid, but jiggles just slightly when you shake the baking sheet. If the crust begins to brown too much as it bakes, you can cover the crust with foil to stop the browning.
step 5:
Remove the pie from the oven and let cool at room temperature for about one hour. Once cool, cut and serve, or cover with foil or plastic and transfer to the refrigerator for storage.

	unit: n/a
	name: crushed red pepper flakes
	amount: 2
	unit: pinches
step 0:
Melt 2 Tbsp butter in a bowl (microwave for about 20 seconds) then add the oyster sauce, soy sauce, brown sugar, and sesame oil. Stir to combine, then set the sauce aside.
step 1:
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Once it reaches a boil, add the spaghetti and continue to boil until the spaghetti is tender (about 7 minutes). Drain the spaghetti in a colander.
step 2:
While the spaghetti is cooking, begin the beef and broccoli. Add the remaining tablespoon butter to a large skillet and melt over medium heat. Add the ground beef and continue to cook over medium heat until the beef is cooked through (5-7 minutes). If you're using a higher fat content beef, drain the fat before moving onto the next step (I used 10% fat and there wasn't enough to drain).
step 3:
While the beef is cooking, mince the garlic. Add the garlic to the skillet with the browned beef and continue to cook over medium heat for 1-2 minutes more, or until the garlic has softened slightly.
step 4:
Add the frozen broccoli florets to the skillet with the beef and garlic. Continue to sauté over medium heat just until the broccoli is no longer frozen. The broccoli will continue to cook in the next steps, so it does not need to be completely heated through at this point.
step 5:
Finally, add the cooked and drained pasta and the prepared sauce to the skillet with the beef and broccoli. Continue to cook and stir until everything is combined, coated in sauce, and heated through. 
step 6:
Slice the green onions and sprinkle over top just before serving, along with a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes, if desired.

	name: whole milk ricotta
	amount: 1/2
	unit: cup
	name: crushed red pepper (optional)
	amount: 1
	unit: pinch
step 0:
Bring a large pot of water to a boil for the pasta. Once boiling, add the bowtie pasta and continue to boil until tender (about 7 minutes). Reserve 1/2 cup of the starchy pasta water before draining in a colander.
step 1:
While the pasta is cooking, prepare the rest of the dish. Wash and slice the mushrooms, then add them to a large skillet along with the olive oil. Sauté over medium heat until the mushrooms have released all their water, the water has evaporated, and the mushrooms begin to brown (about 7 minutes).
step 2:
While the mushrooms are cooking, mince the garlic. Add the garlic and butter to the browned mushrooms and continue to cook over medium for 1-2 minutes more, or just until the garlic softens a bit. 
step 3:
By this time the pasta should be finished cooking. Add about 1/4 cup of the reserved pasta water to the skillet and stir to dissolve any browned bits off the bottom of the skillet. The starchy pasta water and butter will make a slurry that will act as a light "sauce" that helps the salt and pepper adhere to the surface of the pasta.
step 4:
Add the fresh spinach to the skillet and stir just until wilted (1 minute). Add the drained pasta to the skillet and stir until everything is evenly combined. Turn the heat off and season liberally with salt and pepper. If the pasta is dry, you can add an additional splash of the reserved pasta water.
step 5:
Finally, spoon the ricotta on top of the pasta in one-tablespoon dollops. Add a pinch of red pepper on top, if desired, and serve warm.

step 0:
Preheat the oven to 400ºF. Core and dice the apples. Add the apples, cranberries, brown sugar, and salt to a large baking dish. Stir until the apples and cranberries are evenly coated in sugar. Transfer to the oven and roast for 20 minutes. Stir the apples and cranberries, return them to the oven and roast for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cranberries have burst and appear wrinkled.
step 1:
Meanwhile, dice the celery and onion. Add the butter, celery and onion to a large pot. Sauté over medium heat for about 5 minutes, or until the onions are soft and translucent. Chop the pecans.
step 2:
Add 3 cups water to the pot with the celery and onion, place a lid on top, turn the heat up to high, and bring the water up to a boil. Once boiling, add the cornbread stuffing mix and stir briefly to combine. Turn off the heat, place the lid on top and let the stuffing rest for 5 minutes to absorb the liquid.
step 3:
After the stuffing has rested, add the roasted apples and cranberries and chopped pecans. Fold them into the stuffing. Serve immediately, or transfer to a baking dish and bake for about 15 minutes at 350ºF to make the top crispy.

	unit: n/a
step 0:
Dice the onion and mince the garlic. Remove the stem and seeds from the jalapeño, then dice the remaining jalapeño flesh. Add the onion, garlic, jalapeño, and olive oil to a soup pot and sauté over medium heat for about 5 minutes, or until the onions are soft and translucent.
step 1:
While the onion, garlic, and jalapeño are sautèing, use a blender to purée two of the three cans of black beans (with liquid from the can). If the beans are too thick to purée, add just enough water to make them blend.
step 2:
Add all three cans of black beans to the soup pot (one can of whole beans with liquid, two puréed), along with the can of fire roasted diced tomatoes (with juices), the cumin, oregano, and smoked paprika. Stir to combine.
step 3:
Place a lid on the pot and allow the soup to come up to a simmer. Allow the soup to simmer, stirring often, for about 15 minutes. After simmering for 15 minutes, taste and add salt to taste (I added 1/2 tsp). Serve hot with your choice of toppings.
